influential members of the house ways and means committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts
the bill whose backers include chairman dan <unk>:rostenkowski d. ill. would prevent the resolution trust corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an <unk>:rtc-owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget
the bill intends to restrict the rtc to treasury borrowings only unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization
such agency <unk>:self-help ' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive far more expensive than direct treasury borrowing said rep. <unk>:fortney stark d. calif. the bill 's chief sponsor
the complex financing plan in the s&l bailout law includes raising $ N billion from debt issued by the newly created rtc
this financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit
another $ N billion would be raised through treasury bonds which pay lower interest rates
but the rtc also requires working capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold until the assets can be sold separately
that debt would be paid off as the assets are sold leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ N billion or $ N billion including interest over N years
it 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved said david <unk>:cooke executive director of the rtc
the agency has already spent roughly $ N billion selling N insolvent s&ls and it is likely to sell or merge N by the time the bailout concludes
<unk>:absent other working capital he said the rtc would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets
we would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward he said
the complicated language in the huge new law has <unk>:muddied the fight
the law does allow the rtc to borrow from the treasury up to $ N billion at any time
moreover it says the rtc 's total obligations may not exceed $ N billion but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt and <unk>:subtracting from it the market value of the assets the rtc holds
but congress did n't anticipate or intend more public debt say opponents of the rtc 's <unk>:working-capital plan and rep. charles <unk>:schumer d. n.y <unk>:. said the rtc oversight board has been <unk>:remiss in not keeping congress informed
that <unk>:secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from ways and means which seems to me sort of <unk>:draconian he said
the rtc is going to have to pay a price of prior <unk>:consultation on the hill if they want that kind of flexibility
the ways and means committee will hold a hearing on the bill next tuesday
we 're about to see if advertising works
hard on the heels of friday 's 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads <unk>:trumpeting a familiar message keep on investing the market 's just fine
their mission is to keep clients from <unk>:fleeing the market as individual investors did in <unk>:droves after the crash in october
just days after the N crash major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors
this time around they 're moving even faster
painewebber inc. <unk>:filmed a new television commercial at N p.m. edt yesterday and had it on the air by last night
fidelity investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday and wrote another new ad appearing today
shearson lehman hutton inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new tv ads
it considered running them during tomorrow night 's world series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday
other brokerage firms including merrill lynch & co. were <unk>:plotting out potential new ad strategies
the brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic
this time the firms were ready
fidelity for example prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge
when the market went into its free fall friday afternoon the investment firm ordered full pages in the monday editions of half a dozen newspapers
the ads touted fidelity 's automated <unk>:800-number beneath the huge headline fidelity is ready for your call
a fidelity spokesman says the <unk>:800-line which already was operating but which many clients did n't know about received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend
a lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us he says
to maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial
it would have been too late to think about on friday
we had to think about it ahead of time
today 's fidelity ad goes a step further encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with fidelity
<unk>:underneath the headline diversification it <unk>:counsels based on the events of the past week all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market 's volatility
it goes on to plug a few diversified fidelity funds by name
painewebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the N crash
in the aftermath of the N debacle the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night
it also negotiated an arrangement with cable news network under which <unk>:cnn would agree to air its last-minute <unk>:creations
the new painewebber commercial created with ad agency saatchi & saatchi co. features mary farrell one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists <unk>:sounding particularly bullish
taped just as the market closed yesterday it offers ms. farrell advising we view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle <unk>:...
we continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation
the spot was scheduled to appear three times on <unk>:cnn last night
painewebber considered an even harder sell recommending specific stocks
instead it settled on just urging the clients who are its <unk>:lifeline to keep that money in the market
we 're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything which just drives the prices down further says john <unk>:lampe painewebber 's director of advertising
if you owned it and liked it friday the true value has n't changed
he adds this is n't N <unk>:revisited
with the market <unk>:fluctuating and then closing up more than N points yesterday investment firms had to constantly revise their approach
at shearson lehman executives created potential new commercials friday night and throughout the weekend then had to <unk>:regroup yesterday afternoon
the plan had been to make one of shearson 's <unk>:easy-to-film black-and-white where we stand commercials which have been running occasionally in response to news events since N
the ad would have run during the world series tomorrow replacing the debut commercial of shearson 's new ad campaign leadership by example
but in a meeting after the market closed yesterday shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock-market ad
we do n't think at this point anything needs to be said
the market seems to be <unk>:straightening out we 're taking a <unk>:wait-and-see attitude says <unk>:cathleen b. stewart executive vice president of marketing
in any case the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of N
but it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective
in N despite a <unk>:barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms individuals ran from the market en <unk>:masse
now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around
ad notes <unk>:...

in game two on a cool sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn a lot of the catching up was done by the a 's <unk>:catcher terry <unk>:steinbach
he hit a <unk>:2-N pitch from rick <unk>:reuschel into the <unk>:left-field stands in inning four to stretch his team 's lead from <unk>:2-N to a decisive <unk>:5-N where it stayed
so what if <unk>:steinbach had struck just seven home runs in N regular-season games and <unk>:batted in the seventh position of the a 's lineup
if you get your pitch and take a good swing anything can happen he later <unk>:remarked
on saturday night quite a few of the boys in green and gold <unk>:salted away successes to <unk>:salve the pain of past and no doubt future <unk>:droughts

that he was the a 's <unk>:winningest <unk>:pitcher during its american league campaign with a <unk>:21-N mark plus two wins over toronto in the playoffs indicates he may have some evening up coming but with the way his <unk>:split-fingered <unk>:fastball is <unk>:behaving that might not be this week
the same goes for mike moore another veteran who <unk>:overcame early struggles to permit the giants but a run and four hits in seven <unk>:innings in sunday 's contest
every guy they put out there had a better <unk>:split-finger than the guy before <unk>:marveled giant manager roger craig
he 's an <unk>:ex-hurler who 's one of the leading <unk>:gurus of the fashionable delivery which looks like a <unk>:fastball until it <unk>:dives beneath the <unk>:lunging bat
the <unk>:upshot of the <unk>:downshoot is that the a 's go into san francisco 's candlestick park tonight up two games to none in the <unk>:best-of-seven <unk>:fest
the <unk>:stat to <unk>:reckon with here says that about three of four clubs N of N that took <unk>:2-N series leads went on to win it all
that 's not an average to <unk>:soothe giant <unk>:rooters
one might think that the home fans in this series of the subway called bart that 's a better name for a public <unk>:conveyance than desire do n't you think would have been <unk>:ecstatic over the proceedings but they <unk>:observe them in relative calm

a few folks even showed up wearing <unk>:caps bearing the colors and <unk>:emblems of both teams
i 'm for the giants today but only because they lost yesterday
i love <unk>:'em both
the only thing i 'm <unk>:rooting for is for the series to go seven games said david williams a sacramento <unk>:septuagenarian at the <unk>:coliseum before sunday 's go
the above represents a <unk>:triumph of either <unk>:apathy or <unk>:civility
i choose to believe it 's the latter although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here including the a 's and giants is originally from somewhere else
<unk>:suffice it to say that if this were a new york <unk>:yankees-mets series or one between the chicago cubs and white <unk>:sox <unk>:hey it 's possible you 'd need <unk>:uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans and only the <unk>:suicidal would <unk>:bifurcate their <unk>:bonnets
anyway the a 's gave you a lot of heroes to root for
in the opening game besides <unk>:steinbach and stewart there was walt weiss a <unk>:twiggy-looking <unk>:second-year <unk>:shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to <unk>:knee surgery
he was <unk>:flawless <unk>:afield <unk>:ditto in game two moved a <unk>:runner along in the a 's <unk>:three-run second inning and <unk>:homered for his team 's final tally
such is his reputation among the east bay <unk>:bashers that when he hit his first career home run last season the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an <unk>:autograph
not his <unk>:autograph <unk>:power-hitter <unk>:mcgwire 's
an a 's <unk>:co-hero of the second game was <unk>:rickey henderson who <unk>:exemplifies the hot side of the <unk>:hot-cold equation
he <unk>:smoked toronto in the playoffs with six hits seven walks and eight stolen bases in N at <unk>:bats and continued that by going <unk>:3-for-N at the plate sunday along with walking stealing a base and scoring a run
when you 're in the <unk>:groove you see every ball <unk>:tremendously he <unk>:lectured
the cold guys in the set were will clark kevin mitchell and <unk>:matt williams the giants ' <unk>:3-4-N <unk>:hitters
they combined for N hits six home runs and N runs <unk>:batted in in the five games against the cubs
they went a collective <unk>:5-for-N here with zero <unk>:homers and <unk>:ribbies
it 's that last set of numbers as much as anything else that gives the giants hope in the series games to come
i believe in the law of averages declared san francisco <unk>:batting coach dusty baker after game two
i 'd rather see a <unk>:so-so <unk>:hitter who 's hot come up for the other side than a good <unk>:hitter who 's cold
but the old <unk>:dodger <unk>:slugger <unk>:wisely offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side

so it went yesterday in the trading rooms of london 's financial district
in the wake of wall street 's plunge last friday the london market was considered especially vulnerable
and before the opening of trading here yesterday all eyes were on early trading in tokyo for a clue as to how widespread the fallout might be

the house aviation subcommittee approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy-outs of major u.s. airlines
the collapsed plan to acquire ual corp. parent of united airlines spurred quick action on the legislation introduced wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday
the bill is expected to be taken up by the public works and transportation committee tomorrow and a floor vote by next week will be urged
the measure drew criticism from the bush administration and a <unk>:parting shot from financier donald trump who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for amr corp. the parent of american airlines
in a letter to subcommittee chairman james <unk>:oberstar d. minn. mr. trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for amr and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal
<unk>:elaine <unk>:chao deputy transportation secretary also sent a letter to express the administration 's opposition to the bill in its present form
rep. <unk>:oberstar brushed off mr. trump 's allegations as an excuse for his own deal failing
he also said the fact that the other letter had n't come from transportation secretary samuel skinner indicated there is <unk>:wiggle room in the administration 's position
mr. <unk>:oberstar and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation
but they cited the ual and amr examples as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation
aides both in the house and senate said the withdrawal of the trump bid for amr is n't likely to <unk>:deflate efforts to push the legislation
it 's still on the fast track and we still want to do it said one senate aide
the bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy-out
currently the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers but can take the drastic step of <unk>:revoking the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers <unk>:unfit
supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and <unk>:certainty to the <unk>:airline-acquisition process and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry
in general the bill would give the transportation department a 30-day review period before N or more of the voting stock of a major u.s. air carrier could be acquired
it also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition
the bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets or give control to a foreign interest
if more information is needed the secretary would have authority to extend the review period N days
all the witnesses both congressmen and industry experts expressed support for the bill in order to prevent <unk>:profiteers from <unk>:cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe <unk>:cost-effective service
but several committee members <unk>:disapproved some backing mr. trump 's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the ual deal and the stock-market plunge
one of the major concerns expressed by the <unk>:dissenters was that large airlines would be prohibited from <unk>:divesting themselves of smaller entities and producing independent <unk>:spin-off companies
in a possible prelude to the <unk>:resumption of talks between boeing co. and striking machinists union members a federal mediator said representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow
it could be a long meeting or it could be a short one said doug hammond the mediator who called the agreement to meet a first step toward a <unk>:resumption of negotiations
we 're encouraged that talks are scheduled again but beyond that we have made no expression of expectations a boeing spokesman said
the machinists union has rejected a three-year contract offer that would have provided a N wage increase over the life of the pact plus some bonuses
currently average pay for machinists is $ N an hour boeing said
now in its 13th day the strike has <unk>:idled about N machinists and has started to delay delivery of some <unk>:jetliners

as part of the plan dataproducts announced a pact to sell $ N million of its real estate holdings to <unk>:trizec properties inc. a unit of canada 's <unk>:trizec corp

j.p. morgan & co
j.p. morgan as expected posted a $ N billion net loss for the quarter reflecting the new york bank 's decision last month to add $ N billion to reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries
the reserve addition placed the parent of morgan guaranty trust co. among a few major u.s. banks that have covered nearly all their medium and long-term portfolios to less-developed countries with reserves
the latest quarter 's loss <unk>:equals $ N a share
in the year-earlier quarter morgan earned $ N million or $ N a share
george m. <unk>:salem analyst at prudential-bache securities inc. called the results mildly disappointing

net interest income sank N in the quarter to $ N million from $ N million
the interest rate on short-term funds which banks borrow to finance longer-term loans to customers was sharply higher morgan said

these increases were partly offset by lower <unk>:trading-related income the bank said
non-interest expenses grew N to $ N million
ncnb corp
ncnb corp. 's net income more than doubled in the period largely because of continued strong performance by the bank 's texas operations
the charlotte n.c. company said earnings rose to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier
the latest quarter included a gain of $ N million or N cents a share related to the purchase of the remaining N of ncnb texas national bank from the federal deposit insurance corp
the strong performance however <unk>:contrasted with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of ncnb 's problem loans particularly in the southeast
in the third quarter nonperforming assets jumped to $ N million or N of net loans and leases from $ N million or N in the second quarter
<unk>:nonperformers totaled $ N million or N in the year-ago third quarter
included in the increase in the most recent quarter is a $ N million loan which ncnb said it expects to be fully repaid with no loss early in the fourth quarter
the deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of N in ncnb 's southeast operations as well as a N growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign
the higher rates paid on deposits also helped squeeze ncnb 's net interest margin in the southeast to N from N a year earlier
in big board composite trading yesterday ncnb jumped $ N a share to $ N
results were released after the market closed
ncnb texas national formed from the <unk>:remnants of of the failed first <unk>:republicbank corp. of dallas contributed $ N million to ncnb 's bottom line in the third quarter

security pacific corp
security pacific 's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter but the los angeles bank holding company was still able to post a N increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans
net rose to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier
the company said the gain resulted mainly from a $ N million increase in net interest income reflecting a N increase in real estate loans mainly residential and a N rise in consumer loans
these <unk>:high-yielding loans in effect replaced some <unk>:low-yielding assets such as <unk>:inter-bank loans which were allowed to decrease
as a result security pacific 's net interest margin fell only N basis points a more mild decrease than some major banks outside california which have been reporting more sluggish earnings
security pacific shares closed at $ N down N cents in big board composite trading
the earnings represent a N return on assets for security pacific and an N return on equity
the loan growth offset continuing real-estate loan losses in the depressed arizona market

lin broadcasting corp. said it wo n't take a position on a revised tender offer by mccaw cellular communications inc. to buy lin and has asked for <unk>:clarification of the offer
the new offer which seeks N of the cellular and broadcasting concern is for $ N a share for N million lin shares
mccaw 's revised tender offer would require mccaw to begin an auction process in july N that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of lin
lin is asking mccaw to clarify its tender offer which challenges an agreement between bellsouth corp. and lin to merge their <unk>:cellular-telephone businesses
bellsouth has notified lin that it would shortly respond to the mccaw proposal in as full and effective a manner as is <unk>:warranted
the lin board said holders may be <unk>:misled by the provision in the mccaw proposal that guarantees private market value after five years for the remaining shares
mccaw has no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain the lin board said
the board added that mccaw would be able to control lin 's operations and could therefore operate lin in a manner which could <unk>:diminish its private market value and <unk>:attractiveness to a <unk>:third-party <unk>:purchaser in five years

u.s. trade representative carla hills said the first <unk>:dispute-settlement panel set up under the <unk>:u.s.-canadian free trade agreement has ruled that canada 's restrictions on exports of pacific <unk>:salmon and <unk>:herring violate the accord
mrs. hills said the u.s. and canada have until nov. N to resolve the dispute
if a solution is n't reached by then she said the u.s. would have the right to suspend some trade concessions to canada equivalent in value to the losses suffered by u.s. <unk>:fish-processing companies in alaska and the pacific northwest
however in <unk>:ottawa canadian trade minister john <unk>:crosbie said the <unk>:dispute-settlement panel accepted the legitimacy of canada 's position on the use of these landing requirements to <unk>:conserve and manage these important <unk>:fisheries
questioned about the <unk>:seeming <unk>:contradiction in the u.s. and canadian government views of the panel 's report an aide for mrs. hills said the panel had clearly ruled that the canadian trade restrictions are illegal
the u.s. trade representative declined to put a dollar estimate on the losses resulting from the canadian export restrictions
canada initially had an export prohibition that was replaced by regulations requiring that such fish had to be brought <unk>:ashore in british columbia by commercial <unk>:fishermen prior to export
this action was defended by the canadian government on conservation grounds
mrs. hills said yesterday that the <unk>:dispute-settlement panel rejected this canadian government argument
we fully expect that canada will comply with the panel 's ruling that the landing requirement also must be ended she said
earlier an international panel set up under the rules of the general agreement on tariffs and trade in geneva determined that the original canadian <unk>:fish-export restrictions violated gatt rules
mrs. hills said the u.s. wo n't accept any delays after nov. N because u.s. <unk>:fish-processing firms enter into contracts in the fall to purchase the next season 's catch

individual investors investment firms and arbitragers who speculate in the stocks of takeover candidates can suffer liquidity and payment problems when stocks dive those investors often borrow heavily to buy their holdings and use the stocks as collateral for loans
but several large banks said yesterday they detected no signs of unusual demand for credit that would signal such difficulties
we 're seeing nothing out of the ordinary said one official at a top N bank
that 's good news because we all <unk>:swim in this water
added another executive at a big bank we were all a little <unk>:goosey over the weekend trying to forecast what would happen monday but it 's been very quiet
now as for tomorrow hell who knows
what happened friday shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently <unk>:coordinated to handle another <unk>:meltdown in prices
no <unk>:fiddling with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling
but markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency
after the N plunge markets agreed that it would be <unk>:wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose
the new york stock exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers if the dow jones index falls N points in a day the exchange will halt trading for one hour if the decline hits N points the exchange will close for an additional two hours
the rationale is that an <unk>:interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels
it is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic
a temporary <unk>:cessation of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself
but there is also the possibility that <unk>:shutting down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices
what happened friday was the worst of all <unk>:worlds
the futures exchanges followed their own <unk>:pre-set circuit breakers and shut down at about N p.m. for N minutes after the standard & poor 's N stock index had fallen N points or about N points on the dow jones index
options markets stopped trading in many securities
the new york stock exchange under its own rules remained open
with nowhere else to go sellers and particularly program traders focused all their selling on the new york stock exchange
as liquidity on that market weakened prices fell sharply
had the futures and options markets been open additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline most probably would have been less intense
at N after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and washington the futures exchanges reopened
futures trading however was halted altogether at N after the futures markets had dropped an additional N points which is the daily limit for price declines
at this point the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the new york stock exchange
it is time to recognize that the new york stock exchange the futures markets and the options markets though <unk>:physically separate have actually become so closely <unk>:intertwined as to constitute one market effectively
traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them
it therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers
to achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility either all markets should be open to trading or none
<unk>:synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on friday but they probably would have made for <unk>:smoother less volatile executions
it 's time for the exchanges and the securities and exchange commission to agree on joint conditions for <unk>:halting trading or staying open
let 's not have one market shut down for N minutes when the dow declines N points and another shut down for an hour after a <unk>:250-point decline
the need for <unk>:hurried last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that <unk>:synchronize circuit breakers in all markets
the new circuit breakers if they are to be applied at all will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the new york stock exchange remains open
the rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies
should the sec and the commodities futures trading commission which with the sec <unk>:regulates the chicago stock-index markets be unable to agree the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the treasury secretary
in many ways our financial markets are better prepared today to handle a decline than they were two years ago
the new york stock exchange now has the capacity to handle a volume of nearly a billion shares a day
telephone service has been improved for customers trying to reach their brokers and specialists who i believe should stay despite the <unk>:urgings of some post-crash critics have larger capital positions

the continuing series of hud scandals is a <unk>:sadly predictable result of pork-barrel politics
nevertheless <unk>:lobbies such as the national association of home builders nahb continue to pressure capitol hill for more special-interest spending
kent <unk>:colton nahb executive vice president argues that the u.s. faces a <unk>:multifaceted housing crisis reduced <unk>:affordability of homes for first-time buyers increased homelessness and lower apartment construction rates that will be very difficult to solve without expanded federal resources
there 's nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending
but the nahb was created in N out of an organization that made its name fighting a <unk>:roosevelt administration proposal to take over all defense housing production
through the years the association has been an active member of the taxpayer 's coalition pushing for such initiatives as the <unk>:balanced-budget amendment
yet on matters close to <unk>:er home <unk>:..
the hud budget has dropped by more than N since N argues mr. <unk>:colton
we 've taken more than our fair share
i would n't have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit
but nahb support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch over the years the nahb has backed a host of public programs
it once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government and has regularly advanced <unk>:anti-recession housing measures
moreover explains one hud official the nahb remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that specialize in subsidized production
the association is pushing an extensive and expensive <unk>:wish-list which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $ N billion annually
it would like to <unk>:peg the ceiling on federal housing administration mortgage guarantees to N of the median price in a particular market instead of limiting it to $ N reduce or even eliminate fha <unk>:down-payment requirements and increase the availability of <unk>:variable-rate mortgages expand the veterans affairs department loan guarantee program provide adequate funding for the farmers home administration <unk>:fmha increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low-income and rental housing including $ N billion in block grants to states and <unk>:localities and fully fund the <unk>:mckinney act a $ N million <unk>:potpourri for the homeless
direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved <unk>:intolerably expensive in the past and inevitably are <unk>:twisted to the benefit of <unk>:well-connected developers and lobbyists as demonstrated by the ongoing hud scandal or congressmen
indirect subsidies through the fha for instance are little better
though mr. <unk>:colton says expanding fha lending would result in no cost to the government the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing such as low-income to the single-family home market would result in a major expense
more important housing programs run by hud the va and <unk>:fmha are <unk>:awash in red ink
the fha alone lost $ N billion in fiscal N the government 's equity in the agency essentially its reserve fund fell to minus $ N billion
the federal government has had to pump in $ N billion into the va housing program since N to keep the fund afloat and the va requested an additional $ N million for the fiscal year just ended
all told the federal government already guarantees more than $ N billion of mortgages
in its <unk>:nicely produced publication where will our children live the nahb does acknowledge that of course the full measure of housing <unk>:affordability can not be provided by the federal government
it points to the <unk>:pernicious impact of local government regulation particularly <unk>:zoning and building fees which <unk>:pushes the price of housing out of the reach of <unk>:low- and <unk>:middle-income people
but while the nahb has suggested actions that states and <unk>:localities should take to reduce regulatory barriers the association has proposed no activist legislative program comparable to say its detailed request for more federal subsidies to eliminate <unk>:counterproductive controls
the association a majority of whose N members build fewer than N units a year is like many other business <unk>:lobbies
explains <unk>:sheila macdonald of the national taxpayers union it <unk>:treads in two <unk>:worlds
the builders like the subsidies but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues such as the <unk>:balanced-budget amendment
unfortunately the organization 's desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility
two years ago when the nahb lobbied for the $ N billion omnibus housing bill the organization basically dropped out of the taxpayers ' coalition says ms. macdonald
as mr. <unk>:colton of the nahb acknowledges government is not going to solve the problem <unk>:...
the real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down
more money for hud will increase the deficit and <unk>:destabilize the economy more money to municipalities that are <unk>:wrecking their local housing markets will further <unk>:insulate them from the <unk>:destructive effects of their policies

the only strong opposition to changing the ec treaty comes from british prime minister margaret thatcher who is opposed to creating a single ec currency

the <unk>:ceremonies began friday afternoon when word spread that the ual buy-out was <unk>:collapsing
although the <unk>:union-bidder expects to patch together a substitute offer consisting of less cash the failure to get cash from japanese and american banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the <unk>:pageant of <unk>:high-leverage takeover deals is ending
lots of other <unk>:entries made up the parade of course notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices <unk>:signalling federal reserve <unk>:tightness and the bush administration 's temporary defeat in trying to lower the capital-gains tax
as usual few favorable reviews were heard for that <unk>:ever-present <unk>:marching band of program traders although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write
what really spooked the <unk>:crowds along wall street however was the sudden concern that whatever the reason the pool of debt capital is <unk>:drying up

the multibillion-dollar prospects where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks <unk>:andor issue billions in high-yield debt were where the damage was concentrated
the market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for friday 's dramatic march for several weeks
the growing financial difficulties of recent <unk>:high-leverage restructurings or takeovers such as resorts international integrated resources and campeau 's retailing empire have cast a pall over the entire market for high-yield securities
investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by ohio <unk>:mattress and by forcing ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring
as a result high-yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell $ N billion in junk bonds before year-end are experiencing anxious times
these are all market excesses putting aside the <unk>:artificial boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity and what we 've seen is the market <unk>:reining them in
of course washington had n't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle and its tendency to <unk>:meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect but those preliminary steps should n't <unk>:distract us from the basic market <unk>:fundamentalism that was at work on friday
if it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and lbos caused gray friday what are the implications for policy makers
after all the stock market 's response to the collapse of the ual deal might be taken to confirm the <unk>:anti-debt direction of regulators
is this a case where private markets are <unk>:approving of washington 's <unk>:bashing of wall street
absolutely not
to the extent that friday 's sell-off reflected a sudden <unk>:reappraisal of the excesses of leverage the message is that wall street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior
the national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various lbo deals and leveraged restructurings
the recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the <unk>:scarcity of bank capital for recent deals <unk>:underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate
if takeover premiums become excessive if lbo <unk>:dealmakers become too aggressive then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers and the markets will move with <unk>:lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions
yes the broader exchanges got caught up in the <unk>:spiral but they rode the tiger up all year
not surprisingly he sometimes <unk>:bites
the arbitragers and takeover <unk>:initiatiors got killed on gray friday while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered <unk>:lustily
if you identify with the besieged managers you must concede that <unk>:speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from washington
if you side with the arbitragers and raiders you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators although the delaware courts should never be underestimated
the truth is washington understands politics better than economics
although the average citizen is probably not <unk>:harmed too much from washington 's <unk>:rhetorical war against wall street regarding excessive financial <unk>:leveraging actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm
any such attempt to <unk>:distinguish good debt from bad debt or to draw the line at a particular industry such as the airlines is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general
far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against drugs panama and the deficit all of them <unk>:parades that seem never to end

tokyo share prices rebounded tuesday morning with the nikkei index of N selected stocks rising N points to close the morning session at N
the index slid N points or N on monday
in the first N minutes of tuesday 's trading the nikkei index soared N points to N
by N a.m. tokyo time the index was up N points to N as investors hailed new york 's overnight rally
monday 's slide came in a relatively calm session that did n't provide much direction for other markets
shares also closed sharply lower across europe particularly in frankfurt although london and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began to rebound in new york
other asian and pacific markets had sharper losses than tokyo but the selling wave stopped short of <unk>:precipitating another market crash
all eyes were on tokyo at the opening because it was the first major market to trade since friday 's <unk>:N.58-point plunge on wall street
but rather than set the tone for other markets japan 's major institutional investors chose to remain on the sidelines
still despite the sudden <unk>:reappearance of stock-market turbulence managers of japanese investment funds said they were n't planning to unload u.s. or european equities
we did n't trade much today as our policy now is to wait and see said a fund manager at <unk>:taisho life insurance co
we would like to wait and see until trading goes around through europe and new york
the institutions appeared confident that japanese regulators would step in to ensure orderly trading if necessary and there was considerable speculation during the day that the finance ministry was working behind the scenes to do just that
but in the absence of <unk>:panicky trading its presence was never <unk>:overtly felt
at the close the nikkei average of N stocks stood at N down N points or N
the broader tokyo stock price index sank N or N to N
the day 's decline was generally in line with analysts ' weekend predictions
declining issues <unk>:swamped advancers <unk>:941-N
but volume was thin at N million shares compared with N million friday
the market opened sharply lower with the nikkei average down nearly N after N minutes
a midmorning rebound brought it back to show a gain of about N at the end of the morning session but the rally failed in the afternoon and the market closed near the day 's low
the smaller stocks in the tokyo market 's second section also posted their biggest decline of the year
the tokyo stock exchange index for the second section fell N or N to N
many investors trying to outperform the market 's major indexes have <unk>:flocked to these small issues in recent weeks
japanese investors and traders expressed relief that the tokyo market did n't fall more sharply
but its performance did bear some <unk>:resemblance to events of two years ago during the october N global stock market crash
on oct. N N the friday before the black monday crash the new york market dropped N and tokyo followed on monday with a N drop
this time wall street 's plunge of N friday was followed by yesterday 's N loss in tokyo
two years ago tokyo 's biggest fall came the day after new york 's N black monday plunge when the nikkei average fell N
thus market participants yesterday were looking ahead nervously to wall street 's opening
but in new york yesterday the dow jones industrial average surged N to close at N on heavy volume of N shares although declining issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market

unless there is a panic this is the best time to buy as was the case two years ago he said
those shares which had posted gains on <unk>:m&a speculation were dashed with cold water but as far as major stocks are concerned there is n't much impact
other fund managers were similarly <unk>:sanguine

major indexes declined more than N in australia and new zealand and N in hong kong
<unk>:bangkok manila seoul taipei and <unk>:jakarta escaped with slightly smaller losses
brokers and fund managers said the region 's markets were reacting to friday 's wall street plunge even though that decline was due to local factors such as failed corporate buy-outs and a deteriorating junk-bond market
it 's pure psychology said william <unk>:au <unk>:yeung an account executive for drexel burnham lambert <unk>:hk ltd. in hong kong
markets in this region are n't so geared to leveraged buy-outs and their economies generally are in good shape but there 's no doubt that asia is still following america 's lead
several analysts said malaysia and singapore had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows
hong kong is the region 's next most open market but many foreign investors have been staying away from it since it plunged in june amid political turmoil in china
singapore took the hit because when people want to get out they tend to go where the liquidity is said elizabeth hambrecht a regional analyst with baring securities hong kong ltd
she pointed out that even after monday 's N decline the <unk>:straits times index is up N this year so investors who <unk>:bailed out generally did so profitably
similarly kuala lumpur 's composite index yesterday ended N above its N close
in hong kong the hang seng index fell N to finish at N
trading was heavy at about one billion shares compared with N million friday
but the session was orderly in contrast to the market 's four-day <unk>:closure after the N crash
richard <unk>:chenevix-trench a director at hong <unk>:kong-based baring international fund managers ltd. said the market probably has n't hit bottom yet but is close

frank lloyd wright is reported to have said once that if you <unk>:tipped the world on its side everything loose would end up in california

what else is one to make of the <unk>:whacky <unk>:save-the-earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state 's attorney general
if passed by the voters the recently announced initiative would phase out major pesticides reduce carbon dioxide emissions by N ban new offshore drilling ban chemicals thought to <unk>:deplete the ozone layer and create a new state environmental officer armed with a $ N million budget to sue any firm or agency he thinks is being too <unk>:dirty
the initiative is based largely on the <unk>:wish-lists of the green lobby the sierra club the league of conservation voters the natural resources defense council the national <unk>:toxics campaign and the citizens for a better environment
<unk>:interestingly the environmental defense fund is having nothing to do with this one
not only californians but all americans would pay if this thing passed
the initiative bars the sale of any crops in california that do n't meet the initiative 's standards
kansas wheat farmers and florida fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the california market
in other words california is <unk>:presuming to take control of the nation 's farm policy
as usual the green lobby 's proposal is <unk>:disconnected from scientific reality
consider the <unk>:greenhouse-effect provision
the proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of N
even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory it is <unk>:inconceivable that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem
but if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative what is going on
the first place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit
the key here is the <unk>:ambition of state attorney general john van de <unk>:kamp
he 's running for governor
mr. van de <unk>:kamp is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and <unk>:cobbled them into a single <unk>:unwieldy initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on nov. N N
that 's also the day of the gubernatorial election
the initiative seems to have been <unk>:crafted to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy hollywood <unk>:weepers who <unk>:donate money
and it allows mr. van de <unk>:kamp to get around campaign spending limits
he can spend the legal maximum for his campaign all the spending for the van de <unk>:kamp initiative on which there are no limits is <unk>:gravy
this initiative is being labeled the big green but maybe it should be called the big <unk>:greenback
the republican candidate sen. pete wilson is playing the initiative <unk>:fundraising game too <unk>:sponsoring his own crime initiative
while it is possible that the big green initiative will be ruled unconstitutional it is of course <unk>:conceivable that in modern california it could slide through
this is the state that recently passed the <unk>:prop. N <unk>:anti-toxic initiative
if this new proposal ever does become law the green lobby will benefit directly
the initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he does n't like
that means the <unk>:nrdc and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation taxpayers would bear the cost
mr. van de <unk>:kamp and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and <unk>:apple-pie issue among certain segments of california 's population now that almost any collection of <unk>:anti-scientific <unk>:anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its <unk>:rubric
of course the state 's liberals are not yet a nation <unk>:unto themselves
george bush for example may decide that he does n't want to be the president who lost control of interstate commerce to an attorney general from california
and some other segments of california 's political and media culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state 's less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs
this <unk>:grandiose initiative will help california define itself for the future either as a state still <unk>:tethered to economic and scientific reality or as one being led to wherever its <unk>:la-la activists want to take it

the rally gave <unk>:credence at least for now to the <unk>:pre-trading declaration of big board chairman john j. phelan jr. that friday 's market debacle was an <unk>:abnormal condition and not a disaster

there was heavy stock-index arbitrage as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets

the <unk>:onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized

then at N the dow suddenly started to rebound and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the <unk>:early-morning fall
and this time it was n't just the program traders who were responsible
all the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily
the program traders were in there too of course
but according to one trader the programmers did n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was also a lot of bargain-hunting by institutions

a house-senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the continental u.s. and on all flights of six hours or less to alaska and hawaii
the restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less
the exemption allowed on longer flights to alaska and hawaii appears to be largely a <unk>:face-saving <unk>:concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years
by a <unk>:6-N margin house negotiators initially rejected last night a senate provision covering all domestic flights
but the <unk>:six-hour compromise was soon agreed to in subsequent discussions
as a practical matter flights from the west coast to hawaii would be covered as they are under the time limit but the language would exempt longer routes beginning for example in chicago or on the east coast
within the senate the ban has had aggressive support from sen. frank <unk>:lautenberg d. n.j. who has used his position as a senate appropriations subcommittee chairman to <unk>:garner votes for the initiative

the facilities account includes $ N million for denver 's ambitious new airport and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in philadelphia and michigan and the major carriers to denver united and continental
leery of the costs and critics say competition the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of denver
texas air corp. which owns continental and the air transport association were prominent in the lobbying
the industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until denver and the airlines had agreed to leases for N of the gates

while friday 's plunging stock market prompted new fears about the economy 's prospects a <unk>:little-known indicator that has <unk>:faithfully <unk>:foreshadowed the economy 's ups and <unk>:downs by exceptionally long lead times points to a sustained rise in overall business activity
the barometer developed by analysts at columbia university 's center for international business cycle research here reached a record high of N in august the latest month available and the columbia researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then
the latest reading of N was up from N in july and N as recently as march
the august rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator which uses the N average as a base of N
in contrast the commerce department 's widely followed index of leading indicators while up in august has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high early this year
its <unk>:ragged behavior through much of N has prompted some <unk>:forecasters to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year 's end
but the far stronger showing of the columbia index makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely says <unk>:geoffrey h. moore the director of the columbia facility
a leading authority on the business cycle mr. moore also is a member of the business cycle dating group the panel of private economists that decides for the government when <unk>:expansions and recessions begin and end
the group normally <unk>:convenes only when a change in the economy 's general course seems likely
no meeting is scheduled because the expansion shows no sign of going off the tracks mr. moore reports
based largely on the recent strength in their index called the long leading indicator the columbia analysts <unk>:foresee <unk>:uninterrupted economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well
they expect a N rise in N in the gross national product after adjustment for inflation
underlying this optimism is the index 's longstanding ability to signal recessions or <unk>:recoveries as the case may be by substantially greater periods than the commerce department 's index of leading indicators
over the full <unk>:post-world war ii era the columbia index on the average has entered sustained declines N months before the <unk>:onset of recessions and turned up eight months before <unk>:recoveries
the comparable lead times for the commerce index whose components include the stock market are far shorter N months before recessions and only three months before <unk>:recoveries
the columbia economists also have <unk>:reconstructed how the long leading index would have behaved had it existed in N before the stock market crash in october that <unk>:ushered in the great depression
the indicator reached a peak in january N and then fell steadily up to and through the crash
it was an entirely different pattern from what we 're seeing now mr. moore says
a major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the dow jones corporate <unk>:bond-price index which is not a part of the commerce index
in august the bond measure was at its highest monthly average since early N
it also rose last friday while the stock market sagged
other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries the <unk>:mN version of the money supply adjusted for inflation and the volume of new <unk>:home-building permits
notably <unk>:absent from the columbia index is the stock market which mr. moore says is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy 's <unk>:long-range prospects though it still is useful for anticipating some <unk>:short-run <unk>:twists and turns
as recently as N the stock market as reflected in the standard & poor 's index of N common stocks was rated by the national bureau of economic research as the best of the N leading indicators that then made up the commerce index
it was assigned a mark of N out of a possible N compared with scores ranging as low as N for the other components
the stock market has lost some <unk>:precursory power analysts at the columbia center claim because of the growing impact of international developments
stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy mr. moore says citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets the <unk>:foreign-trade balance and inflows of foreign capital

mr. stanley is on trial over charges that he violated a <unk>:proclamation issued by the south african administrator general earlier this year which made it a crime punishable by two years in prison for any person to <unk>:insult <unk>:disparate or <unk>:belittle the election commission
the stanley affair does n't <unk>:bode well for the future of democracy or freedom of anything in namibia when swapo starts running the government
to the extent mr. stanley has done anything wrong it may be that he is out of step with the consensus of world intellectuals that the <unk>:namibian guerrillas were above all else the victims of <unk>:suppression by neighboring south africa

copper and crude oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash yesterday could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy
copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that had been supporting prices appeared to be solved
crude oil declined early but as the stock market retained early gains it too became stronger ending with a small net loss

britain 's blue arrow plc intends to change its name to manpower plc and write off a chunk of the nearly $ N billion in good will realized in the takeover of <unk>:u.s.-based manpower inc
blue arrow chairman mitchell fromstein said in an interview that the two steps may be a prelude to <unk>:reincorporating the world 's biggest <unk>:employment-services group in the u.s.
mr. fromstein disclosed the planned steps expected within a few months as blue arrow posted a N drop in its third-quarter pretax earnings
the name change and good will write-off could help <unk>:solidify blue arrow 's dominance of the u.s. <unk>:temporary-help market and give it a more american image as u.s. investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after friday 's market plunge
u.s. holders now own more than N of blue arrow compared with N last january
in the u.s. market the recognition of the manpower name is <unk>:infinitely stronger than blue arrow mr. fromstein said
the moves also could <unk>:erase shareholders ' perception of blue arrow as a company in turmoil
it further <unk>:reinforces the concept that blue arrow is a thing of the past said doug arthur an analyst at kidder peabody & co. in new york
the proposed changes all make a lot of sense to me he added
in a widely publicized <unk>:boardroom coup mr. fromstein ousted <unk>:antony berry as blue arrow chief executive in january a month after mr. berry had forced mr. fromstein out as the $ N <unk>:million-a-year chief of <unk>:milwaukee-based manpower
mr. fromstein <unk>:solidified his control in april by taking over from mr. berry as chairman
but the blue arrow <unk>:tumult is n't over yet as the british government is investigating a disputed # N million $ N million loan which mr. fromstein has said was made under mr. berry 's direction
blue arrow was able to pull off the $ N billion takeover of manpower in N largely because different british and american accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for british companies
under british rules blue arrow was able to write off at once the $ N billion in good will arising from the purchase
as a <unk>:u.s.-based company blue arrow would have to <unk>:amortize the good will over as many as N years creating a continuing drag on reported earnings
good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets
but with so many shares now held in the u.s. blue arrow reports its earnings two ways based on both u.k. and u.s. accounting standards
our balance sheets look like they came from alice 's <unk>:wonderland mr. fromstein said
the british version shows a handful of pounds of net worth following the N write-off of good will while the american version reflects $ N billion of net worth because almost none of the good will has been written off
mr. fromstein said he hopes to <unk>:eradicate some of the good will left on blue arrow 's u.s. books in one fell <unk>:swoop but would n't specify how much
people close to blue arrow suggested the write-down would represent a sizable chunk with executives claiming prior management <unk>:overstated the extent of manpower 's good will
that move along with the return to the manpower name could bolster the company 's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help
the number of u.s. temporary workers fell about N in the N months ending aug. N after sliding nearly N in july said kidder peabody 's mr. arthur
blue arrow blamed the pretax profit drop in the quarter ended july N partly on slower earnings growth of <unk>:non-manpower units in britain
overall pretax profit slid to # N million in the quarter from # N million a year earlier
richard g. sim the man credited with <unk>:transforming applied power inc. from an <unk>:underachiever into a <unk>:feisty player in the global market for <unk>:hydraulic tools hopes to guide a similar turnaround at the company 's latest acquisition barry wright corp
the 45-year-old former general electric co. executive figures it will be easier this time
but analysts while <unk>:applauding the acquisition say applied 's chief executive faces a tough challenge in <unk>:integrating the two companies
barry wright acquired by applied for $ N million makes <unk>:computer-room equipment and <unk>:vibration-control systems
the <unk>:watertown mass. company 's sales have been <unk>:dormant and its profits have dropped
last year 's earnings of $ N million including $ N from a restructuring gain were far below the year-earlier $ N million
besides spurring barry wright 's sales which were $ N million in N mr. sim must <unk>:pare its costs and product line
the question is how long it 's going to take barry wright to make a contribution says f. john <unk>:mirek an analyst at blunt ellis <unk>:loewi in milwaukee
the answer will help determine whether applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by mr. sim
the butler wis. manufacturer went public at $ N a share in august N and mr. sim 's goal then was a $ N per-share price by N
strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule in august N
the stock has since <unk>:softened trading around $ N a share last week and closing yesterday at $ N in national over-the-counter trading
but mr. sim has set a fresh target of $ N a share by the end of
reaching that goal says robert t. <unk>:foote applied 's chief financial officer will require efficient reinvestment of cash by applied and <unk>:continuation of its healthy N rate of return on operating capital
in barry wright mr. sim sees a situation very similar to the one he faced when he joined applied as president and chief operating officer in N
applied then a closely held company was <unk>:stagnating under the management of its controlling family
while profitable it was n't growing and was n't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital he says
mr. sim is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at barry wright as it has at applied
he also <unk>:professes an <unk>:evangelical <unk>:fervor to develop a corporate culture that rewards managers who produce and where <unk>:decision-making is shared
mr. sim considers the new unit 's operations fundamentally sound and adds that barry wright has been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n't interested larger competitors
with a little patience these businesses will perform very <unk>:satisfactorily mr. sim says
within about six months things will be moving in the right direction he predicts
mr. sim figures it will be easier to turn barry wright around since he 's now in the driver 's seat
when he came to applied i did n't have the power to execute as i do today he says
he was named chief executive officer of applied in N and became chairman last november
at applied mr. sim set growth as his first objective
he took the company public in an offering that <unk>:netted applied about $ N million which helped launch the company 's acquisition program
sales climbed to an estimated $ N million in fiscal N ended aug. N from $ N million in fiscal N
the company expects that earnings which have marched steadily upward in recent years reached about $ N million or $ N a share in the fiscal year just ended up from $ N million in fiscal N and $ N million in N

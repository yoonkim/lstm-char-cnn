but while the new york stock exchange did n't fall apart friday as the dow jones industrial average plunged N points most of it in the final hour it barely managed to stay this side of chaos
some circuit breakers installed after the october N crash failed their first test traders say unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures
the N stock specialist firms on the big board floor the buyers and sellers of last resort who were criticized after the N crash once again could n't handle the selling pressure
big investment banks refused to step up to the plate to support the beleaguered floor traders by buying big blocks of stock traders say

many money managers and some traders had already left their offices early friday afternoon on a warm autumn day because the stock market was so quiet
then in a <unk>:lightning plunge the dow jones industrials in barely an hour surrendered about a third of their gains this year <unk>:chalking up a <unk>:N.58-point or N loss on the day in <unk>:gargantuan trading volume

at the end of the day N million shares were traded
the dow jones industrials closed at N
the dow 's decline was second in point terms only to the <unk>:508-point black monday crash that occurred oct. N N
in percentage terms however the dow 's dive was the <unk>:12th-worst ever and the sharpest since the market fell N or N a week after black monday
the dow fell N on black monday
shares of ual the parent of united airlines were extremely active all day friday reacting to news and rumors about the proposed $ N billion buy-out of the airline by an <unk>:employee-management group
wall street 's takeover-stock speculators or risk arbitragers had placed unusually large bets that a takeover would succeed and ual stock would rise
at N p.m. edt came the <unk>:sickening news the big board was <unk>:halting trading in ual pending news
on the exchange floor as soon as ual stopped trading we <unk>:braced for a panic said one top floor trader
several traders could be seen shaking their heads when the news <unk>:flashed
for weeks the market had been nervous about takeovers after campeau corp. 's cash crunch spurred concern about the prospects for future highly leveraged takeovers
and N minutes after the ual trading halt came news that the ual group could n't get financing for its bid
at this point the dow was down about N points
the market <unk>:crumbled
arbitragers could n't dump their ual stock but they rid themselves of nearly every rumor stock they had
for example their selling caused trading halts to be declared in usair group which closed down N N to N N delta air lines which fell N N to N N and <unk>:philips industries which sank N to N N
these stocks eventually reopened
but as panic spread speculators began to sell blue-chip stocks such as philip morris and international business machines to offset their losses
when trading was halted in philip morris the stock was trading at N down N N while ibm closed N N lower at N
selling <unk>:snowballed because of waves of automatic stop-loss orders which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels
most of the stock selling pressure came from wall street professionals including computer-guided program traders
traders said most of their major institutional investors on the other hand sat tight
now at N one of the market 's post-crash reforms took hold as the s&p N futures contract had plunged N points equivalent to around a <unk>:100-point drop in the dow industrials
under an agreement signed by the big board and the chicago mercantile exchange trading was temporarily halted in chicago
after the trading halt in the s&p N pit in chicago waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the big board and specialists continued to <unk>:notch prices down
as a result the link between the futures and stock markets <unk>:ripped apart
without the <unk>:guidepost of stock-index futures the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the big board
the futures halt was even <unk>:assailed by big board floor traders
it <unk>:screwed things up said one major specialist
this confusion effectively halted one form of program trading stock index arbitrage that closely links the futures and stock markets and has been blamed by some for the market 's big swings
in a stock-index arbitrage sell program traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference
when the airline information came through it <unk>:cracked every model we had for the marketplace said a managing director at one of the largest program-trading firms
we did n't even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do
but stocks kept falling
the dow industrials were down N points at N p.m. before the <unk>:futures-trading halt
at N p.m. at the end of the cooling off period the average was down N points
meanwhile during the the s&p trading halt s&p futures sell orders began <unk>:piling up while stocks in new york kept falling sharply
big board chairman john j. phelan said yesterday the circuit breaker worked well <unk>:mechanically
i just think it 's <unk>:nonproductive at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things
under another post-crash system big board president richard <unk>:grasso mr. phelan was flying to <unk>:bangkok as the market was falling was talking on an <unk>:inter-exchange hot line to the other exchanges the securities and exchange commission and the federal reserve board
he <unk>:camped out at a high-tech <unk>:nerve center on the floor of the big board where he could watch <unk>:updates on prices and pending stock orders
at about N p.m. edt s&p futures resumed trading and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line
buyers stepped in to the futures pit
but the <unk>:build-up of s&p futures sell orders weighed on the market and the link with stocks began to fray again
at about N the s&p market <unk>:careened to still another limit of N points down and trading was locked again
futures traders say the s&p was <unk>:signaling that the dow could fall as much as N points
during this time small investors began ringing their brokers wondering whether another crash had begun
at prudential-bache securities inc. which is trying to cater to small investors some <unk>:demoralized brokers thought this would be the final <unk>:confidence-crusher
that 's when george l. ball chairman of the prudential insurance co. of america unit took to the internal <unk>:intercom system to declare that the plunge was only mechanical

the release cautioned that there are significant differences between the current environment and that of october N and that there are still attractive investment opportunities in the stock market
however jeffrey b. lane president of shearson lehman hutton inc. said that friday 's plunge is going to set back relations with customers because it <unk>:reinforces the concern of volatility
and i think a lot of people will <unk>:harp on program trading
it 's going to bring the debate right back to the <unk>:forefront
as the dow average ground to its final N loss friday the s&p pit stayed locked at its <unk>:30-point trading limit
jeffrey <unk>:yass of program trader <unk>:susquehanna investment group said N s&p contracts were for sale on the close the equivalent of $ N million in stock
but there were no buyers
while friday 's debacle involved mainly professional traders rather than investors it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning traders said
stock-index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself
at those levels stocks are set up to be <unk>:hammered by index arbitragers who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall and simultaneously sell off stocks
but nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today
the <unk>:de-linkage between the stock and futures markets friday will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether wall street is properly prepared for another crash situation
the big board 's mr. <unk>:grasso said our <unk>:systemic performance was good
but the exchange will look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks
obviously we 'll take a close look at any situation in which we think the <unk>:dealer-community obligations were n't met he said

the group is led by jay <unk>:shidler chief executive officer of <unk>:shidler investment corp. in <unk>:honolulu and a. boyd simpson chief executive of the atlanta-based simpson organization inc
mr. <unk>:shidler 's company specializes in commercial real-estate investment and claims to have $ N billion in assets mr. simpson is a developer and a former senior executive of l.j. hooker
the assets are good but they require more money and management than can be provided in l.j. hooker 's current situation said mr. simpson in an interview
hooker 's philosophy was to build and sell
we want to build and hold
l.j. hooker based in atlanta is operating with protection from its creditors under chapter N of the u.s. bankruptcy code
its parent company hooker corp. of sydney australia is currently being managed by a court-appointed provisional <unk>:liquidator
sanford <unk>:sigoloff chief executive of l.j. hooker said yesterday in a statement that he has not yet seen the bid but that he would review it and bring it to the attention of the creditors committee
the $ N million bid is estimated by mr. simpson as representing N of the value of all hooker real-estate holdings in the u.s.
not included in the bid are <unk>:bonwit teller or b. altman & co. l.j. hooker 's department-store chains

we do n't anticipate any problems in raising the funding for the bid said <unk>:allan campbell the head of mergers and acquisitions at <unk>:hoare <unk>:govett in an interview
<unk>:hoare <unk>:govett is acting as the consortium 's investment bankers
according to people familiar with the consortium the bid was <unk>:code-named project <unk>:klute a reference to the film <unk>:klute in which a <unk>:prostitute played by actress <unk>:jane <unk>:fonda is saved from a <unk>:psychotic businessman by a police officer named john <unk>:klute
l.j. hooker was a small <unk>:home-building company based in atlanta in N when mr. simpson was hired to push it into commercial development
the company grew modestly until N when a majority position in hooker corp. was acquired by australian developer george <unk>:herscu currently hooker 's chairman
mr. <unk>:herscu <unk>:proceeded to launch an ambitious but <unk>:ill-fated $ N billion acquisition binge that included <unk>:bonwit teller and b. altman & co. as well as majority positions in merksamer jewelers a sacramento chain <unk>:sakowitz inc. the <unk>:houston-based retailer and <unk>:parisian inc. the southeast department-store chain
eventually mr. simpson and mr. <unk>:herscu had a falling out over the direction of the company and mr. simpson said he resigned in N
since then hooker corp. has sold its interest in the <unk>:parisian chain back to <unk>:parisian 's management and is currently attempting to sell the b. altman & co. chain
in addition robert <unk>:sakowitz chief executive of the <unk>:sakowitz chain is seeking funds to buy out the hooker interest in his company

as small investors <unk>:peppered their mutual funds with phone calls over the weekend big fund managers said they have a strong defense against any wave of withdrawals cash
unlike the weekend before black monday the funds were n't <unk>:swamped with heavy withdrawal requests
and many fund managers have built up cash levels and say they will be buying stock this week
at fidelity investments the nation 's largest fund company telephone volume was up sharply but it was still at just half the level of the weekend preceding black monday in N
the boston firm said <unk>:stock-fund redemptions were running at less than one-third the level two years ago
as of yesterday afternoon the redemptions represented less than N of the total cash position of about $ N billion of fidelity 's stock funds
two years ago there were massive redemption levels over the weekend and a lot of fear around said c. bruce <unk>:johnstone who runs fidelity investments ' $ N billion <unk>:equity-income fund
this feels more like a <unk>:one-shot deal
people are n't <unk>:panicking
the test may come today
friday 's stock market sell-off came too late for many investors to act
some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made after friday 's close would take place at today 's closing prices
stock fund redemptions during the N debacle did n't begin to <unk>:snowball until after the market opened on black monday
but fund managers say they 're ready
many have raised cash levels which act as a buffer against steep market declines
mario <unk>:gabelli for instance holds cash positions well above N in several of his funds
windsor fund 's john <unk>:neff and mutual series ' michael price said they had raised their cash levels to more than N and N respectively this year
even peter lynch manager of fidelity 's $ N billion <unk>:magellan fund the nation 's largest stock fund built up cash to N or $ N million
one reason is that after two years of monthly net redemptions the fund posted net inflows of money from investors in august and september
i 've let the money build up mr. lynch said who added that he has had trouble finding stocks he likes
not all funds have raised cash levels of course
as a group stock funds held N of assets in cash as of august the latest figures available from the investment company institute
that was modestly higher than the N and N levels in august and september of N
also persistent redemptions would force some fund managers to dump stocks to raise cash
but a strong level of investor withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around fund managers said
a major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since black monday
<unk>:stock-fund sales have rebounded in recent months but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half N levels
there 's not nearly as much <unk>:froth said john <unk>:bogle chairman of vanguard group inc. a big valley forge pa. fund company
many fund managers argue that now 's the time to buy
vincent <unk>:bajakian manager of the $ N billion wellington fund added to his positions in bristol-myers squibb woolworth and dun & bradstreet friday

fidelity 's mr. lynch for his part snapped up southern co. shares friday after the stock got <unk>:hammered
if the market drops further today he said he 'll be buying blue chips such as bristol-myers and kellogg

major mutual-fund groups said phone calls were <unk>:arriving at twice the normal weekend pace yesterday

they hope to avoid the <unk>:jammed phone lines and other <unk>:snags that <unk>:infuriated some fund investors in october N
fidelity on saturday opened its N <unk>:walk-in investor centers across the country
the centers normally are closed through the weekend
in addition east coast centers will open at N edt this morning instead of the normal N
t. rowe price associates inc. increased its staff of phone representatives to handle investor requests
the <unk>:baltimore-based group noted that some investors moved money from stock funds to money-market funds
but most investors seemed to be in an information mode rather than in a transaction mode said steven <unk>:norwitz a vice president
and vanguard among other groups said it was adding more phone representatives today to help investors get through
in an unusual move several funds moved to calm investors with <unk>:recordings on their <unk>:toll-free phone lines
we view friday 's market decline as offering us a buying opportunity as long-term investors a recording at <unk>:gabelli & co. funds said over the weekend
the <unk>:janus group had a similar recording for investors
several fund managers expect a rough market this morning before prices stabilize
some early selling is likely to stem from investors and portfolio managers who want to lock in this year 's fat profits

<unk>:elaine <unk>:garzarelli who runs shearson lehman hutton inc. 's $ N million sector analysis portfolio predicts the market will open down at least N points on technical factors and some panic selling
but she expects prices to rebound soon and is telling investors she expects the stock market wo n't decline more than N to N from recent highs
this is not a major crash she said
nevertheless ms. <unk>:garzarelli said she was <unk>:swamped with phone calls over the weekend from nervous shareholders
half of them are really scared and want to sell she said but i 'm trying to talk them out of it
she added if they all were bullish i 'd really be upset
the backdrop to friday 's slide was <unk>:markedly different from that of the october N crash fund managers argue
two years ago unlike today the dollar was weak interest rates were rising and the market was very <unk>:overvalued they say
from the investors ' standpoint institutions and individuals learned a painful lesson <unk>:... by selling at the lows on black monday said stephen boesel manager of the $ N million t. rowe price growth and income fund
this time i do n't think we 'll get a panic reaction
newport corp. said it expects to report <unk>:fiscal-first-quarter earnings of between N cents and N cents a share somewhat below analysts ' estimates of N cents to N cents

<unk>:ripples from the strike by N machinists union members against boeing co. reached air carriers friday as america west airlines announced it will postpone its new service out of houston because of delays in receiving aircraft from the seattle jet maker
peter <unk>:otradovec vice president for planning at the phoenix ariz. carrier said in an interview that the work <unk>:stoppage at boeing now entering its 13th day has caused some turmoil in our scheduling and that more than N passengers who were booked to fly out of houston on america west would now be put on other airlines
mr. <unk>:otradovec said boeing told america west that the N it was supposed to get this thursday would n't be delivered until nov. N the day after the airline had been planning to <unk>:initiate service at houston with four daily flights including three <unk>:nonstops to phoenix and one <unk>:nonstop to las vegas
now those routes are n't expected to begin until jan
boeing is also supposed to send to america west another N <unk>:twin-engine aircraft as well as a N by year 's end
those too are almost certain to arrive late
at this point no other america west flights including its new service at san antonio texas newark n.j. and <unk>:palmdale calif. have been affected by the delays in boeing deliveries
nevertheless the company 's reaction <unk>:underscores the <unk>:domino effect that a huge manufacturer such as boeing can have on other parts of the economy
it also is sure to help the machinists put added pressure on the company
i just do n't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged <unk>:walkout tom baker president of machinists ' district N said in an interview yesterday
i do n't think their customers would like it very much
america west though is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be
i figure that american and united probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets they might not miss one at all mr. <unk>:otradovec said
indeed a random check friday did n't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations
southwest airlines has a boeing <unk>:737-N set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time
it 's so close to completion boeing 's told us there wo n't be a problem said a southwest spokesman
a spokesman for amr corp. said boeing has assured american airlines it will deliver a N on time later this month
american is preparing to take delivery of another N in early december and N more next year and is n't anticipating any changes in that timetable
in seattle a boeing spokesman explained that the company has been in constant communication with all of its customers and that it was impossible to predict what further disruptions might be triggered by the strike
meanwhile supervisors and <unk>:non-striking employees have been trying to finish some N aircraft mostly N and N jumbo jets at the company 's <unk>:everett wash. plant that were all but completed before the <unk>:walkout
as of friday four had been delivered and a fifth plane a <unk>:747-N was supposed to be <unk>:flown out over the weekend to air china
no date has yet been set to get back to the bargaining table
we want to make sure they know what they want before they come back said doug hammond the federal mediator who has been in contact with both sides since the strike began
the investment community for one has been anticipating a <unk>:speedy resolution
though boeing 's stock price was battered along with the rest of the market friday it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders
the market has taken two views that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very <unk>:rosy for boeing in the long term said howard <unk>:rubel an analyst at <unk>:cyrus j. lawrence inc
boeing 's shares fell $ N friday to close at $ N in composite trading on the new york stock exchange
but mr. baker said he thinks the earliest a pact could be struck would be the end of this month <unk>:hinting that the company and union may resume negotiations as early as this week
still he said it 's possible that the strike could last considerably longer
i would n't expect an immediate resolution to anything
last week boeing chairman frank <unk>:shrontz sent striking workers a letter saying that to my knowledge boeing 's offer represents the best overall three-year contract of any major u.s. industrial firm in recent history
but mr. baker called the letter and the company 's offer of a N wage increase over the life of the pact plus bonuses very weak
he added that the company <unk>:miscalculated the union 's resolve and the workers ' <unk>:disgust with being forced to work many hours overtime
in separate developments talks have broken off between machinists representatives at lockheed corp. and the <unk>:calabasas calif. aerospace company
the union is continuing to work through its expired contract however

the projects are big
they can be c$ N billion plus mr. <unk>:richardson said
but we would n't go into them alone and canadian utilities ' equity stake would be small he said
<unk>:ideally we 'd like to be the operator of the project and a modest equity investor
our long suit is our proven ability to operate power plants he said
mr. <unk>:richardson would n't offer <unk>:specifics regarding <unk>:atco 's proposed british project but he said it would compete for customers with two huge british power generating companies that would be formed under the country 's plan to <unk>:privatize its massive water and electric utilities
britain 's government plans to raise about # N billion $ N billion from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities beginning next month
the planned electric utility sale scheduled for next year is alone expected to raise # N billion making it the world 's largest public offering
under terms of the plan independent <unk>:generators would be able to compete for N of customers until N and for another N between N and N
canadian utilities had N revenue of c$ N billion mainly from its natural gas and electric utility businesses in alberta where the company serves about N customers
there seems to be a move around the world to <unk>:deregulate the generation of electricity mr. <unk>:richardson said and canadian utilities hopes to capitalize on it
this is a real thrust on our utility side he said adding that canadian utilities is also <unk>:mulling projects in <unk>:underdeveloped countries though he would be specific
canadian utilities is n't alone in exploring power generation opportunities in britain in anticipation of the privatization program

the land to be purchased by the joint venture has n't yet received <unk>:zoning and other approvals required for development and part of <unk>:kaufman & broad 's job will be to obtain such approvals
the partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development but in return it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices which can result in sizable savings said bruce <unk>:karatz president and chief executive officer of <unk>:kaufman & broad
there are really very few companies that have adequate capital to buy properties in a raw state for cash
typically developers option property and then once they get the administrative approvals they buy it said mr. <unk>:karatz adding that he believes the joint venture is the first of its kind
we usually operate in that conservative manner
by setting up the joint venture <unk>:kaufman & broad can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land while avoiding the negative <unk>:impacts to its own balance sheet mr. <unk>:karatz said
the company is putting up only N of the capital although it is responsible for providing management planning and processing services to the joint venture
this is one of the best ways to assure a pipeline of land to fuel our growth at a minimum risk to our company mr. <unk>:karatz said

some securities analysts are looking for no better than break-even results from the company for the third quarter compared with year-earlier profit of $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N million
the stock having lost nearly a quarter of its value since sept. N closed at $ N share down $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading friday
to a degree quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so-called commodity plastics that <unk>:pervade modern life
having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history these producers now see their prices eroding
pricing cycles to be sure are nothing new for plastics producers
and the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the <unk>:heady period that is just behind them
we were all wonderful heroes last year says an executive at one of quantum 's competitors
now we 're at the bottom of the <unk>:heap
at quantum which is based in new york the trouble is magnified by the company 's heavy <unk>:dependence on plastics
once known as national <unk>:distillers & chemical corp. the company <unk>:exited the wine and spirits business and <unk>:plowed more of its resources into plastics after mr. <unk>:stookey took the chief executive 's job in N
mr. <unk>:stookey N years old declined to be interviewed for this article but he has consistently argued that over the long haul across both the <unk>:peaks and the <unk>:troughs of the plastics market quantum will <unk>:prosper through its new direction
quantum 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene <unk>:resin used to make garbage bags milk <unk>:jugs <unk>:housewares toys and meat packaging among other items
in the u.s. polyethylene market quantum has claimed the largest share about N
but its competitors including dow chemical co. union carbide corp. and several oil giants have much broader business interests and so are better <unk>:cushioned against price swings
when the price of polyethylene moves a mere penny a pound quantum 's annual profit <unk>:fluctuates by about N cents a share provided no other <unk>:variables are changing
in recent months the price of polyethylene even more than that of other commodity plastics has taken a dive
benchmark grades which still sold for as much as N cents a pound last spring have skidded to between N cents and N cents
meanwhile the price of <unk>:ethylene the chemical building block of polyethylene has n't dropped nearly so fast
that <unk>:discrepancy <unk>:hurts quantum badly because its own plants cover only about half of its <unk>:ethylene needs
by many accounts an early hint of a price rout in the making came at the start of this year
china which had been putting in huge orders for polyethylene abruptly halted them
<unk>:calculating that excess polyethylene would soon be <unk>:sloshing around the world other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather than order new product
kenneth mitchell director of dow 's polyethylene business says producers were surprised to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices <unk>:spiraled up
people were even <unk>:hoarding bags he says
now producers hope prices have hit bottom
they recently announced increases of a few cents a pound to take effect in the next several weeks
no one knows however whether the new posted prices will stick once producers and customers start to <unk>:haggle
one <unk>:doubter is george <unk>:krug a <unk>:chemical-industry analyst at oppenheimer & co. and a bear on plastics stocks
noting others ' estimates of when price increases can be sustained he remarks some say october
some say november
i say N
he argues that efforts to firm up prices will be undermined by producers ' plans to expand production capacity
a quick turnaround is crucial to quantum because its cash requirements remain heavy
the company is trying to carry out a three-year $ N billion <unk>:plant-expansion program started this year
at the same time its annual payments on long-term debt will more than double from a year ago to about $ N million largely because of debt taken on to pay a $ <unk>:50-a-share special dividend earlier this year
quantum described the payout at the time as a way for it to share the <unk>:bonanza with its holders because its stock price was n't reflecting the huge profit increases
some analysts saw the payment as an effort also to <unk>:dispel takeover speculation
whether a cash crunch might eventually force the company to cut its quarterly dividend raised N to N cents a share only a year ago has become a topic of intense speculation on wall street since mr. <unk>:stookey <unk>:deflected dividend questions in a sept. N meeting with analysts
some viewed his response that company directors review the dividend regularly as nothing more than the standard line from executives
but others came away thinking he had given something less than his usual <unk>:straight-from-the-shoulder performance
in any case on the day of the meeting quantum 's shares slid $ N to $ N in big board trading
on top of everything else quantum <unk>:confronts a disaster at its plant in morris ill
after an explosion <unk>:idled the plant in june the company <unk>:progressed in september to within N hours of completing the <unk>:drawn-out process of <unk>:restarting it
then a second explosion occurred
two workers died and six remain in the hospital
this human toll adds the most painful <unk>:dimension yet to the sudden change in quantum 's fortunes
until this year the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up <unk>:trade-group safety <unk>:awards
a prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another <unk>:imponderable into quantum 's financial future
when a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand <unk>:calculating lost profit and thus claims under <unk>:business-interruption insurance is <unk>:straightforward
but the numbers become <unk>:trickier and subject to <unk>:dickering between insured and insurer when demand is shifting
you say you could have sold x percent of this product and <unk>:y percent of that recalls <unk>:theodore <unk>:semegran an analyst at shearson lehman hutton who went through this exercise during his former career as a chemical engineer
and then you still have to negotiate
quantum hopes the morris plant where limited production got under way last week will resume full operation by year 's end
the plant usually accounts for N to N of quantum 's polyethylene production and N of its <unk>:ethylene production
not everything looks grim for quantum
the plant expansion should strengthen the company 's <unk>:sway in the polyethylene business where market share is often taken through sheer capacity
by lifting <unk>:ethylene production the expansion will also lower the company 's raw material costs
quantum is also tightening its grip on its one large business outside chemicals propane marketing
through a venture with its investment banker first boston corp. quantum completed in august an acquisition of <unk>:petrolane inc. in a transaction valued at $ N billion
<unk>:petrolane is the second-largest propane distributor in the u.s.
the largest suburban propane was already owned by quantum
still quantum has a crisis to get past right now
some analysts speculate the weakening stock may yet attract a suitor
the name <unk>:surfacing in rumors is british petroleum co. which is looking to expand its polyethylene business in the u.s.
asked about a bid for quantum a <unk>:bp spokesman says we pretty much have a policy of not commenting on rumors and i think that falls in that category
rjr nabisco inc. is <unk>:disbanding its division responsible for buying network advertising time just a month after moving N of the group 's N employees to new york from atlanta
a spokesman for the new york-based food and tobacco giant taken private earlier this year in a $ N billion leveraged buy-out by kohlberg kravis roberts & co. confirmed that it is <unk>:shutting down the rjr nabisco broadcast unit and <unk>:dismissing its N employees in a move to save money
the spokesman said rjr is discussing its <unk>:network-buying plans with its two main advertising firms <unk>:fcbleber katz and <unk>:mccann <unk>:erickson
we found with the size of our media purchases that an ad agency could do just as good a job at significantly lower cost said the spokesman who declined to specify how much rjr spends on network television time
an executive close to the company said rjr is spending about $ N million on network television time this year down from roughly $ N million last year
the spokesman said the broadcast unit will be <unk>:disbanded dec. N and the move wo n't affect rjr 's print radio and <unk>:spot-television buying practices
the broadcast group had been based in new york until a year ago when rjr 's previous management moved it to atlanta the company 's headquarters before this summer
one employee with the group said rjr moved N employees of the group back to new york in september because there was supposed to be a future
he said the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks wooing them from jobs with advertising agencies
the rjr spokesman said the company moved the N employees to new york last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks ' <unk>:upcoming season
the studies on closing the unit could n't be completed until now he said
the group 's president peter <unk>:chrisanthopoulos was n't in his office friday afternoon to comment
the u.s. which is <unk>:finalizing its <unk>:steel-import quotas is <unk>:allocating a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which have relatively <unk>:unsubsidized steel industries
meanwhile the u.s. has negotiated a significant cut in japan 's steel quota and made only a minor increase to the steel <unk>:allotment for the european community
brazil similar to mexico and south korea is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the u.s. market than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas which expired sept. N
brazil and venezuela are the only two countries that have n't completed steel talks with the u.s. for the year ending oct. N N
in recent years u.s. steelmakers have supplied about N of the N million tons of steel used annually by the nation
of the remaining N needed the <unk>:steel-quota negotiations <unk>:allocate about N to foreign suppliers with the difference supplied mainly by canada which is n't included in the quota program
other countries that do n't have formal steel quotas with the u.s. such as taiwan sweden and argentina also have supplied steel
some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the u.s. that are similar to quotas
the bush administration earlier this year said it would extend steel quotas known as voluntary restraint agreements until march N N
it also said it would use that <unk>:two-and-a-half year period to work toward an international consensus on <unk>:freeing up the international steel trade which has been <unk>:notoriously managed subsidized and protected by governments
the u.s. termed its plan a trade <unk>:liberalization program despite the fact that it is merely an extension
mexico which was one of the first countries to conclude its steel talks with the u.s. virtually doubled its quota to N of the u.s. steel market from N under the previous quotas
south korea which had N under the previous quotas is set to get a small increase to about N
that increase rises to slightly more than N of the u.s. market if a joint <unk>:korean-u.s. steel project is included
meanwhile brazil is expected to increase its allowance from the N share it has had in recent years
the ec and japan the u.s. 's largest steel suppliers have n't been filling their quotas to the full extent
the ec steel industry which has been coping with strong european demand has been supplying about N of the u.s. market compared with recent quotas of about N
japan has been shipping steel to total about N of the u.s. market compared with a quota of N
in the recent talks the ec had its quota increased about N tons to N of the u.s. market from N in N
but its quota has been as high as N in N
japan however has agreed to cut its quota to about N from N previously
japan the ec brazil mexico and south korea provide about N of the steel imported to the u.s. under the quota program
the balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters such as australia and venezuela
the u.s. had about an extra N of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks
that was essentially made up of a N increase in the overall quota program and N from cutting japan 's allowance
negotiators from the white house trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year when they will have another N of the u.s. steel market to <unk>:allocate
these <unk>:optional <unk>:1-a-year increases to the steel quota program are built into the bush administration 's <unk>:steel-quota program to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and <unk>:protectionism from their own steel industries
<unk>:elcotel inc. expects fiscal second-quarter earnings to trail N results but anticipates that several new products will lead to a much stronger performance in its second half
<unk>:elcotel a telecommunications company had net income of $ N or five cents a share in its year-earlier second quarter ended sept. N
revenue totaled $ N million
george <unk>:pierce chairman and chief executive officer said in an interview that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under $ N million
the lower results mr. <unk>:pierce said reflect a 12-month decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones <unk>:elcotel 's primary business
although mr. <unk>:pierce expects that line of business to strengthen in the next year he said <unk>:elcotel will also benefit from moving into other areas
<unk>:foremost among those is the company 's <unk>:entrance into the public facsimile business mr. <unk>:pierce said
within the next year <unk>:elcotel expects to place N fax machines made by <unk>:minolta in japan in hotels municipal buildings <unk>:drugstores and other public <unk>:settings around the country
<unk>:elcotel will provide a credit-card reader for the machines to collect store and forward billing data
mr. <unk>:pierce said <unk>:elcotel should realize a minimum of $ N of <unk>:recurring net earnings for each machine each month
<unk>:elcotel has also developed an automatic call <unk>:processor that will make further use of the company 's system for <unk>:automating and handling credit-card calls and collect calls
automatic call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone mr. <unk>:pierce said not just phones produced by <unk>:elcotel
the company will also be producing a new line of convenience telephones which do n't accept coins for use in hotel <unk>:lobbies office <unk>:lobbies <unk>:hospitality <unk>:lounges and similar <unk>:settings
mr. <unk>:pierce estimated that the processors and convenience phones would produce about $ N of <unk>:recurring net earnings for each machine each month
britain 's retail price index rose N in september from august and was up N for the year the central statistical office said
<unk>:quest medical inc. said it adopted a shareholders ' rights plan in which rights to purchase shares of common stock will be distributed as a dividend to shareholders of record as of oct. N
the company said the plan was n't adopted in response to any known offers for <unk>:quest a maker and marketer of hospital products
the rights allow shareholders to purchase <unk>:quest stock at a discount if any person or group acquires more than N of the company 's common stock or <unk>:announces a tender offer
measuring <unk>:cups may soon be replaced by <unk>:tablespoons in the <unk>:laundry room
procter & gamble co. plans to begin testing next month a <unk>:superconcentrated detergent that will require only a few <unk>:spoonfuls per <unk>:washload
the move stems from <unk>:lessons learned in japan where local competitors have had <unk>:phenomenal success with concentrated <unk>:soapsuds
it also marks p&g 's growing concern that its japanese rivals such as <unk>:kao corp. may bring their <unk>:superconcentrates to the u.s.
the cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in japan when <unk>:kao introduced a powerful detergent called attack which quickly won a N stake in the japanese markets
they do n't want to get caught again says one industry <unk>:watcher
retailers in phoenix ariz. say p&g 's new <unk>:powdered detergent to be called <unk>:cheer with color guard will be on shelves in that market by early november
a p&g spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to phoenix started late last month
she said the company will study results from this market before expanding to others
<unk>:superconcentrates are n't entirely new for p&g
the company introduced a <unk>:superconcentrated <unk>:lemon <unk>:cheer in japan after watching the success of attack
when attack hit the shelves in N p&g 's share of the japanese market fell to about N from more than N
with the help of <unk>:lemon <unk>:cheer p&g 's share is now estimated to be N
while the japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products the true test for p&g will be in the $ N billion u.s. detergent market where growth is slow and <unk>:liquids have gained <unk>:prominence over <unk>:powders
the company may have chosen to market the product under the <unk>:cheer name since it 's already expanded its <unk>:best-selling tide into N different <unk>:varieties including this year 's big hit tide with <unk>:bleach
with <unk>:superconcentrates however it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more many people tend to dump too much detergent into the <unk>:washing machine <unk>:believing that it takes a cup of <unk>:powder to really clean the <unk>:laundry
in the early 1980s p&g tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the <unk>:ariel brand name that it markets in europe
but the product which was n't as concentrated as the new <unk>:cheer <unk>:bombed in a market test in denver and was dropped
p&g and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric <unk>:softener <unk>:combinations in <unk>:pouches but they have n't sold well despite the convenience
but p&g contends the new <unk>:cheer is a unique formula that also offers an <unk>:ingredient that prevents colors from <unk>:fading
and retailers are expected to <unk>:embrace the product in part because it will take up less shelf space
when shelf space was cheap bigger was better says <unk>:hugh <unk>:zurkuhlen an analyst at salomon <unk>:bros
but with so many brands <unk>:vying for space that 's no longer the case
if the new <unk>:cheer sells well the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own <unk>:superconcentrates
then retailers will probably push the <unk>:less-established brands out altogether he says
competition is bound to get tougher if <unk>:kao <unk>:introduces a product like attack in the u.s.
to be sure <unk>:kao would n't have an easy time taking u.s. market share away from the mighty p&g which has about N of the market
<unk>:kao officials previously have said they are interested in selling <unk>:detergents in the u.s. but so far the company has focused on acquisitions such as last year 's purchase of andrew <unk>:jergens co. a cincinnati <unk>:hand-lotion maker
it also has a <unk>:product-testing facility in california
some believe p&g 's interest in a <unk>:superconcentrated detergent goes beyond the concern for the japanese
this is something p&g would do with or without <unk>:kao says mr. <unk>:zurkuhlen
with economic tension between the u.s. and japan worsening many japanese had feared last week 's visit from u.s. trade representative carla hills
they expected a new <unk>:barrage of demands that japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the u.s.
instead they got a discussion of the need for the u.s. and japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view
mrs. hills ' first trip to japan as america 's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month 's visit by commerce secretary robert a. mosbacher
mr. mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade
he said such results should be <unk>:measurable in dollars and cents in reducing the u.s. trade deficit with japan
but mrs. hills speaking at a breakfast meeting of the american chamber of commerce in japan on saturday stressed that the objective is not to get definitive action by spring or summer it is rather to have a blueprint for action
she added that she expected perhaps to have a down payment <unk>:... some small step to convince the american people and the japanese people that we 're moving in <unk>:earnest
how such remarks translate into policy wo n't become clear for months
american and japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach <unk>:betwen mr. mosbacher and mrs. hills
many called it simply a contrast in styles
but some saw it as a classic negotiating <unk>:tactic
others said the bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand
and some said it reflected the growing debate in washington over pursuing free trade with japan <unk>:versus some kind of managed trade
asked to compare her visit to mr. mosbacher 's mrs. hills replied i did n't hear every word he spoke but as a general proposition i think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the bush administration
yet more than one american official who sat in with her during three days of talks with japanese officials said her tone often was surprisingly <unk>:conciliatory
i think my line has been very consistent mrs. hills said at a news conference saturday afternoon
i am painted sometimes as <unk>:ferocious perhaps because i have a <unk>:ferocious list of statutes to implement
i do n't feel very <unk>:ferocious
i do n't feel either hard or soft
i feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade
when she met the local press for the first time on friday mrs. hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products <unk>:satellites and <unk>:supercomputers three areas targeted under the <unk>:super N provision of the N trade bill
she <unk>:highlighted <unk>:exclusionary business practices that the u.s. government has identified
but her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition
she said the trade <unk>:imbalance was mainly due to <unk>:macroeconomic factors and should n't be <unk>:tackled by setting <unk>:quantitative targets
at her news conference for japanese reporters one economics journalist <unk>:summed up the japanese sense of relief
my impression was that you would be a scary old lady he said drawing a few nervous <unk>:chuckles from his colleagues
but i am relieved to see that you are beautiful and <unk>:gentle and <unk>:intelligent and a person of integrity
mrs. hills ' remarks did raise questions at least among some u.s. officials about what exactly her stance is on u.s. access to the japanese semiconductor market
the u.s. share of the japanese market has been stuck around N for years
many americans have interpreted a N agreement as <unk>:assuring u.s. companies a N share by N but the japanese have denied making any such promise
at one of her news conferences mrs. hills said i believe we can do much better than N
but she stressed i am against managed trade
i will not enter into an agreement that <unk>:stipulates to a percentage of the market
traditional industries inc. said it expects to report a net loss for the fourth quarter that ended june N and is seeking new financing
the seller of photographic products and services said it is considering a number of financing alternatives including seeking increases in its credit lines
traditional declined to estimate the amount of the loss and would n't say if it expects to show a profit for the year
in the year ended june N N traditional reported net income of $ N million or $ N a share
the company did n't break out its fourth-quarter results
in the latest nine months net income was $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million
separately the company said it would file a delayed <unk>:fiscal-year report with the securities and exchange commission within approximately N days
it said the delay resulted from difficulties in <unk>:resolving its accounting of a settlement with the federal trade commission
under an agreement filed in federal court in august to settle ftc objections to some traditional sales practices traditional said it would establish a $ N trust fund to provide refunds to certain customers
information international inc. said it was sued by a buyer of its computerized <unk>:newspaper-publishing system alleging that the company failed to correct deficiencies in the system
a spokesman for information international said the lawsuit by two units of morris communications corp. seeks <unk>:restitution of the system 's about $ N million purchase price and cancellation of a software license provided by the morris units to information international for alleged failure to pay royalties
information international said it believes that the complaints filed in federal court in georgia are without merit
closely held morris communications is based in <unk>:augusta <unk>:ga
the units that filed the suit are <unk>:southeastern newspapers corp. and florida publishing co
<unk>:syms corp. completed the sale of its a. <unk>:sulka & co. subsidiary a men 's luxury <unk>:haberdashery to <unk>:luxco investments

the oil industry 's <unk>:middling profits could <unk>:persist through the rest of the year
major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability
the gasoline picture may improve this quarter but chemicals are likely to remain weak industry executives and analysts say reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance
the industry is seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals glenn cox president of phillips petroleum co. said in an interview
that change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings for the industry in general he added
he did n't forecast phillips 's results
but securities analysts say phillips will be among the companies <unk>:hard-hit by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings
so too many analysts predict will exxon corp. chevron corp. and amoco corp
typical is what happened to the price of <unk>:ethylene a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies
it has plunged N since july to around N cents a pound
a year ago <unk>:ethylene sold for N cents <unk>:peaking at about N cents last december
a big reason for the chemical price retreat is <unk>:overexpansion
beginning in <unk>:mid-N prices began accelerating as a growing u.s. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand
companies added capacity <unk>:furiously
now greatly increased supplies are on the market while the dollar is stronger and domestic economic growth is slower
third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker
refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year said william <unk>:randol a securities analyst at first boston corp
oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in july and august that did n't <unk>:materialize
the excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period
in addition crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier further <unk>:pressuring profitability
refiners say margins picked up in september and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter though still not to the level of N 's fourth quarter
during the N second half many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits
crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies ' earnings this year
prices averaging roughly $ N a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier have stayed well above most companies ' expectations
demand has been much stronger than anticipated and it typically <unk>:accelerates in the fourth quarter
we could see higher oil prices this year said <unk>:bryan <unk>:jacoboski an analyst at painewebber inc
that will translate into sharply higher production profits particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $ N a barrel in the fourth quarter
while oil prices have been better than expected natural gas prices have been worse
in the third quarter they averaged about N less than they were in N
the main reason remains weather
last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to <unk>:burn more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air <unk>:conditioning use
this summer on the other hand had <unk>:milder weather than usual
we 've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices said mr. cox phillips 's president
the lagging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected
going into the fourth quarter natural gas prices are anywhere from N to N lower than a year earlier
for instance natural gas currently produced along the gulf coast is selling on the spot market for around $ N a thousand cubic feet down N from $ N a thousand cubic feet a year ago
the bush administration trying to blunt growing demands from western europe for a <unk>:relaxation of controls on exports to the soviet bloc is questioning whether italy 's <unk>:ing <unk>:. c. olivetti & co. supplied <unk>:militarily valuable technology to the soviets
most of the western european members of <unk>:coordinating committee on <unk>:multilateral export controls the <unk>:unofficial forum through which the u.s. and its allies <unk>:align their <unk>:export-control policies are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in paris oct. N and N
they plan to press specifically for a <unk>:relaxation of rules governing exports of machine tools computers and other high-technology products
but the bush administration says it wants to see evidence that all cocom members are <unk>:complying fully with existing <unk>:export-control procedures before it will support further <unk>:liberalization
to make its point it is challenging the italian government to explain reports that olivetti may have supplied the soviet union with sophisticated computer-driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft
the london sunday times which first reported the u.s. concerns cited a u.s. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that olivetti exported $ N million in <unk>:embargoed <unk>:state-of-the-art flexible manufacturing systems to the soviet aviation industry
olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in N
a state department spokesman acknowledged that the u.s. is discussing the allegations with the italian government and cocom but declined to confirm any details
italian president <unk>:francesco <unk>:cossiga promised a quick investigation into whether olivetti broke cocom rules
president bush called his attention to the matter during the italian leader 's visit here last week
olivetti has denied that it violated cocom rules <unk>:asserting that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the italian authorities
although the <unk>:legality of these sales is still an open question the disclosure could n't be better <unk>:timed to support the position of <unk>:export-control <unk>:hawks in the pentagon and the intelligence community
it seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important cocom meeting said a washington lobbyist for a number of u.s. computer companies
the bush administration has sent <unk>:conflicting signals about its <unk>:export-control policies reflecting <unk>:unhealed divisions among several competing agencies
last summer mr. bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual <unk>:liberalization when he told a north atlantic treaty organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the cocom <unk>:embargo of strategic goods
but more recently the pentagon and the commerce department openly <unk>:feuded over the extent to which cocom should <unk>:liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc
however these agencies generally agree that the west should be cautious about any further <unk>:liberalization
there 's no evidence that the soviet program to illegally acquire western technology has diminished said a state department spokesman
salomon brothers international ltd. a british subsidiary of salomon inc. announced it will issue warrants on shares of hong kong telecommunications ltd
the move closely follows a similar offer by salomon of warrants for shares of <unk>:hongkong & shanghai banking corp
under the latest offer hk$ N million us$ N million of three-year warrants will be issued in london each giving buyers the right to buy one hong kong telecommunications share at a price to be determined friday
the N million warrants will be priced at hk$ N each and are expected to carry a premium to the share price of about N
in trading on the stock exchange of hong kong the shares closed wednesday at hk$ N each
at this price the shares would have to rise above hk$ N for subscribers to salomon 's issue to profitably convert their warrants
while hong kong companies have in the past issued warrants on their own shares salomon 's warrants are the first here to be issued by a third party
salomon will cover the warrants by buying sufficient shares or options to purchase shares to cover its entire position
bankers said warrants for hong kong stocks are attractive because they give foreign investors wary of volatility in the colony 's stock market an opportunity to buy shares without taking too great a risk
the hong kong telecommunications warrants should be attractive to buyers in europe the bankers added because the group is one of a handful of blue-chip stocks on the hong kong market that has international appeal
financial corp. of santa barbara filed suit against former stock <unk>:speculator ivan f. boesky and drexel burnham lambert inc. charging they <unk>:defrauded the thrift by <unk>:concealing their relationship when <unk>:persuading it to buy $ N million in high-yield high-risk junk bonds
in a suit filed in federal court thursday the s&l alleged that a disproportionate number of the bonds it purchased in N declined in value
financial corp. purchased the bonds the suit alleged after mr. boesky and drexel negotiated an agreement for <unk>:vagabond hotels to purchase a N stake in the thrift for about $ N million
<unk>:vagabond hotels was controlled by mr. boesky who currently is serving a prison term for securities violations
officials at drexel said they had n't seen the suit and thus could n't comment
in addition to $ N million <unk>:compensatory damages the suit seeks $ N million in punitive damages
also named in the suit is ivan f. boesky corp. and <unk>:northview corp. the successor company to <unk>:vagabonds hotels

ideal basic industries inc. said its directors reached an agreement in principle calling for <unk>:hofi north america inc. to combine its north american cement holdings with ideal in a transaction that will leave ideal 's minority shareholders with N of the combined company

while corn and soybean prices have slumped well below their <unk>:drought-induced <unk>:peaks of N wheat prices remain <unk>:stubbornly high
and they 're likely to stay that way for months to come analysts say
for one thing even with many farmers <unk>:planting more winter wheat this year than last tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into N the analysts say
and if rain does n't fall soon across many of the great plains ' <unk>:wheat-growing areas yields in the crop now being planted could be reduced further <unk>:squeezing supplies
also supporting prices are expectations that the soviet union will place substantial buying orders over the next few months
by next may N stocks of u.s. wheat to be carried over into the next season before the winter wheat now being planted is <unk>:harvested are projected to drop to N million <unk>:bushels
that would be the lowest level since the early 1970s
stocks were N million <unk>:bushels on may N of this year
in response to <unk>:dwindling domestic supplies agriculture secretary <unk>:clayton <unk>:yeutter last month said the u.s. government would slightly increase the number of acres farmers can plant in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments
the government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about N million <unk>:bushels
it now estimates production for next year at just under N billion <unk>:bushels compared with this year 's estimated N billion and a <unk>:drought-stunted N billion in N

on the chicago board of trade friday wheat for december delivery settled at $ N a bushel unchanged
in theory at least tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a <unk>:supply-demand squeeze said daniel <unk>:basse a futures analyst with <unk>:agresource co. in chicago
such a situation can <unk>:wreak havoc as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the chicago board of trade
in july the <unk>:cbot ordered <unk>:ferruzzi <unk>:finanziaria s.p <unk>:. a. to liquidate futures positions equal to about N million <unk>:bushels of soybeans

orange <unk>:juice traders will be watching to see how long and how far the price decline that began friday will go
late thursday after the close of trading the market received what would normally have been a bullish u.s. department of agriculture estimate of the <unk>:1989-N florida orange crop
it was near the low range of estimates at N million <unk>:90-pound boxes compared with N million boxes last season
however as expected brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its <unk>:juice concentrate to about $ N a pound from around $ N
friday 's <unk>:consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the u.s. report might have had and sent the november orange <unk>:juice contract down as much as N cents a pound at one time
it settled with a loss of N cents at $ N a pound
brazilian <unk>:juice after a delay caused by drought at the start of its crop season is beginning to arrive in the u.s. in large quantities
brazil wants to stimulate demand for its product which is going to be in <unk>:plentiful supply
the price cut one analyst said appeared to be aimed even more at europe where consumption of brazilian <unk>:juice has fallen
it 's a <unk>:dollar-priced product and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in europe the analyst said
new york futures prices have dropped significantly from more than $ N a pound at midyear
barring a cold <unk>:snap or other crop problems in the growing areas downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into january when <unk>:harvesting and processing of <unk>:oranges in florida reach their peak the analyst said
energy
although some analysts look for profit-taking in the wake of friday 's leap in crude oil prices last week 's rally is generally expected to continue this week
i would continue to look for a stable crude market at least in futures trading said william <unk>:hinton an energy futures broker with <unk>:stotler & co
friday capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets
on the new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate crude for november delivery finished at $ N a barrel up N cents on the day
on european markets meanwhile spot prices of north sea <unk>:crudes were up N to N cents a barrel
this market still wants to go higher said <unk>:nauman <unk>:barakat a first vice president at shearson lehman hutton inc
he predicted that the november contract will reach $ N a barrel or more on the new york mercantile exchange
there has been little news to account for such <unk>:buoyancy in the oil markets
analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some fuels and <unk>:crudes
there also are <unk>:recurring reports that the soviet union is having difficulties with its oil exports and that <unk>:nigeria has about reached its production limit and ca n't produce as much as it could sell
many traders <unk>:foresee a tightening of near-term supplies particularly of high-quality <unk>:crudes such as those produced in the north sea and in <unk>:nigeria
if a hostile <unk>:predator emerges for saatchi & saatchi co. <unk>:co-founders charles and maurice saatchi will lead a management buy-out attempt an official close to the company said
financing for any takeover attempt may be <unk>:problematic in the wake of friday 's stock-market sell-off in new york and turmoil in the junk-bond market
but the beleaguered british advertising and consulting giant which last week named a new chief executive officer to replace maurice saatchi has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks
last week saatchi 's largest shareholder <unk>:southeastern asset management said it had been approached by one or more third parties interested in a possible restructuring
and carl spielvogel chief executive officer of saatchi 's big backer spielvogel bates advertising unit said he had offered to lead a management buy-out of the company but was rebuffed by charles saatchi
mr. spielvogel said he would n't launch a hostile bid
the executive close to saatchi & saatchi said that if a bidder came up with a <unk>:ludicrously high offer a crazy offer which saatchi knew it could n't beat it would have no choice but to recommend it to shareholders
but otherwise it would undoubtedly come back with an offer by management
the executive said any buy-out would be led by the current board whose chairman is maurice saatchi and whose strategic <unk>:guiding force is believed to be charles saatchi
mr. spielvogel is n't part of the board nor are any of the other heads of saatchi 's big <unk>:u.s.-based ad agencies
the executive did n't name any price but securities analysts have said saatchi would fetch upward of $ N billion
the executive denied speculation that saatchi was bringing in the new chief executive officer only to clean up the company financially so that the brothers could lead a buy-back
that speculation <unk>:abounded friday as industry executives <unk>:analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive robert <unk>:louis-dreyfus who joins saatchi and becomes a member of its board on jan. N
mr. <unk>:louis-dreyfus formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm <unk>:ims international inc. has a reputation as a <unk>:savvy financial manager and will be charged largely with <unk>:repairing saatchi 's poor financial state
asked about the speculation that mr. <unk>:louis-dreyfus has been hired to <unk>:pave the way for a buy-out by the brothers the executive replied that is n't the reason dreyfus has been brought in
he was brought in to turn around the company
separately several saatchi agency clients said they believe the company 's management <unk>:shakeup will have little affect on them
it has n't had any impact on us nor do we expect it to said a spokeswoman for miller brewing co. a major client of backer spielvogel
john <unk>:lampe director of advertising at painewebber inc. a saatchi & saatchi advertising client said we have no problem with the announcement because we do n't know what change it 's going to bring about
we are n't going to change agencies because of a change in london
executives at backer spielvogel client <unk>:avis inc. as well as at saatchi client <unk>:philips lighting co. also said they saw no effect
executives at prudential-bache securities inc. a backer spielvogel client that is reviewing its account declined comment
mr. spielvogel had said that prudential-bache was prepared to finance either a management buy-out and restructuring or a buy-out of backer spielvogel alone led by him

newspaper publishers are reporting mixed third-quarter results aided by favorable newsprint prices and hampered by flat or declining advertising <unk>:linage especially in the northeast
adding to <unk>:unsteadiness in the industry seasonal retail ad spending patterns in newspapers have been upset by shifts in ownership and general <unk>:hardships within the retail industry
in new york the <unk>:bonwit teller and b. altman & co. department stores have filed for protection from creditors under chapter N of the federal bankruptcy code while the r.h. macy & co. bloomingdale 's and saks fifth avenue department-store chains are for sale
many papers throughout the country are also faced with a slowdown in <unk>:classified-ad spending a booming category for newspapers in recent years
until recently industry analysts believed <unk>:decreases in retail ad spending had <unk>:bottomed out and would in fact increase in this year 's third and fourth quarters
all bets are off analysts say because of the shifting ownership of the retail chains
improved paper prices will help offset weakness in <unk>:linage but the retailers ' problems have affected the amount of ad <unk>:linage they usually run said edward j. <unk>:atorino industry analyst for salomon brothers inc
retailers are just in disarray
for instance <unk>:gannett co. posted an N gain in net income as total ad pages dropped at usa today but advertising revenue rose because of a higher circulation rate base and increased rates
<unk>:gannett 's N daily and N <unk>:non-daily newspapers reported a N increase in advertising and circulation revenue
total advertising <unk>:linage was modestly lower as <unk>:classified-ad volume increased while there was softer demand for retail and national ad <unk>:linage said john <unk>:curley <unk>:gannett 's chief executive officer
at usa today ad pages totaled N for the quarter down N from the N period which was helped by increased ad spending from the summer olympics
while usa today 's total paid ad pages for the year to date totaled N a decrease of N from last year the paper 's ad revenue increased N in the quarter and N in the nine months
in the nine months <unk>:gannett 's net rose N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share
revenue gained N to $ N billion from $ N billion
at dow jones & co. third-quarter net income fell N from the year-earlier period
net fell to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share
the year-earlier period included a one-time gain of $ N million or four cents a share
revenue gained N to $ N million from $ N million
the drop in profit reflected in part continued softness in financial advertising at the wall street journal and barron 's magazine
ad <unk>:linage at the journal fell N in the third quarter
affiliated publications inc. reversed a year-earlier third quarter net loss
the publisher of the boston globe reported net of $ N million or N cents a share compared with a loss of $ N million or N cents a share for the third quarter in N
william o. taylor the parent 's chairman and chief executive officer said earnings continued to be hurt by softness in ad volume at the boston newspaper
third-quarter profit estimates for several companies are being strongly affected by the price of newsprint which in the last two years has had several price increases
after a supply crunch caused prices to rise N since N to $ N a metric ton analysts are encouraged because they do n't expect a price increase for the rest of this year
companies with daily newspapers in the northeast will need the stable newsprint prices to ease damage from weak ad <unk>:linage
mr. <unk>:atorino at salomon brothers said he estimates that times mirror co. 's earnings were down for the third quarter because of soft advertising levels at its long island <unk>:newsday and hartford <unk>:courant newspapers
trouble on the east coast was likely offset by improved ad <unk>:linage at the los angeles times which this week also unveiled a <unk>:redesign
new york times co. is expected to report lower earnings for the third quarter because of continued weak advertising levels at its flagship new york times and deep discounting of newsprint at its affiliate forest products group
times co. 's regional daily newspapers are holding up well but there is little sign that things will improve in the new york market said alan <unk>:kassan an analyst with shearson lehman hutton
washington post co. is expected to report improved earnings largely because of increased cable revenue and publishing revenue helped by an improved retail market in the washington area
according to analysts profits were also helped by successful cost-cutting measures at newsweek
the <unk>:news-weekly has faced heightened competition from rival time magazine and a relatively flat magazine advertising market
knight-ridder inc. is faced with continued uncertainty over the pending joint operating agreement between its detroit free press and <unk>:gannett 's detroit news and has told analysts that earnings were down in the third quarter
however analysts point to positive advertising spending at several of its major daily newspapers such as the miami herald and san jose mercury news
the miami market is coming back strong after a tough couple of years when knight-ridder was starting up a hispanic edition and circulation was falling said bruce <unk>:thorp an analyst for <unk>:provident national bank
general motors corp. in a series of moves that angered union officials in the u.s. and canada has signaled that as many as five north american assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s as the corporation struggles to cut its excess <unk>:vehicle-making capacity
in announcements to workers late last week gm effectively signed death <unk>:notices for two <unk>:full-sized van assembly plants and cast serious doubt on the futures of three u.s. car factories
gm is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker 's u.s. market share skidded during the past decade
the company currently using about N of its north american vehicle capacity has vowed it will run at N of capacity by N
just a month ago gm announced it would make an aging assembly plant in <unk>:lakewood ga. the eighth u.s. assembly facility to close since N
now gm appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s
one reason is mounting competition from new japanese car plants in the u.s. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than gm can match
another is that united auto workers union officials have signaled they want tighter <unk>:no-layoff provisions in the new big three national contract that will be negotiated next year
gm officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin
the problem however is that gm 's moves are coming at a time when <unk>:uaw leaders are trying to <unk>:silence <unk>:dissidents who charge the union is too passive in the face of gm layoffs
against that backdrop <unk>:uaw vice president stephen p. <unk>:yokich who recently became head of the union 's gm department issued a statement friday <unk>:blasting gm 's <unk>:flagrant <unk>:insensitivity toward union members
the auto maker 's decision to let word of the latest <unk>:shutdowns and product <unk>:reassignments <unk>:trickle out in separate <unk>:communiques to the affected plants showed disarray and an inability or <unk>:unwillingness to provide consistent information mr. <unk>:yokich said
gm officials told workers late last week of the following moves production of <unk>:full-sized vans will be consolidated into a single plant in <unk>:flint mich
that means two plants one in <unk>:scarborough ontario and the other in <unk>:lordstown ohio probably will be shut down after the end of N
the <unk>:shutdowns will idle about N canadian assembly workers and about N workers in ohio
robert white canadian auto workers union president used the impending <unk>:scarborough shutdown to <unk>:criticize the <unk>:u.s.-canada free trade agreement and its champion prime minister brian <unk>:mulroney
but canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate gm move that affects three u.s. car plants and one in quebec
workers at plants in van <unk>:nuys calif. oklahoma city and <unk>:pontiac mich. were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the <unk>:pontiac <unk>:firebird and chevrolet <unk>:camaro muscle cars
gm is studying whether it can build the new <unk>:camaro-firebird profitably at a plant in st. <unk>:therese quebec company and union officials said
that announcement left union officials in van <unk>:nuys and oklahoma city uncertain about their futures
the van <unk>:nuys plant which employs about N workers does n't have a product to build after N
jerry <unk>:shrieves <unk>:uaw local president said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a <unk>:flex plant which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand
at the oklahoma city plant which employs about N workers building the <unk>:eight-year-old <unk>:a-body <unk>:mid-sized cars steve <unk>:featherston <unk>:uaw local vice president said the plant has no new product lined up and none of us knows when the <unk>:a-body cars will die
he said he believes gm has plans to keep building <unk>:a-body cars into the mid-1990s
at <unk>:pontiac however the <unk>:camaro-firebird decision appears to <unk>:erase <unk>:uaw hopes that gm would reopen the <unk>:shuttered assembly plant that last built the <unk>:plastic-bodied <unk>:two-seater <unk>:pontiac <unk>:fiero model
the <unk>:fiero plant was viewed as a model of <unk>:union-management cooperation at gm before slow sales of the <unk>:fiero forced the company to close the factory last year
union officials have taken a beating politically as a result
dissident <unk>:uaw members have used the <unk>:fiero plant as a symbol of labor-management cooperation 's failure
<unk>:institut merieux s.a. of france said the canadian government raised an obstacle to its proposed acquisition of connaught <unk>:biosciences inc. for N million canadian dollars us$ N million
merieux said the government 's minister of industry science and technology told it that he was n't convinced that the purchase is likely to be of net benefit to canada
canadian investment rules require that big foreign takeovers meet that standard
the french company said the government gave it N days in which to submit information to further support its takeover plan
both merieux and connaught are biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing concerns
the government 's action was unusual
alan <unk>:nymark executive vice president of investment canada which oversees foreign takeovers said it marked the first time in its four-year history that the agency has made an adverse <unk>:net-benefit decision about the acquisition of a publicly traded company
he said it has reached the same conclusions about some attempts to buy closely held concerns but eventually allowed those acquisitions to proceed
this is n't a change in government policy this provision has been used before said <unk>:jodi redmond press secretary for <unk>:harvie <unk>:andre canada 's minister of industry science and technology
mr. <unk>:andre issued the ruling based on a recommendation by investment canada
spokesmen for merieux and connaught said they had n't been informed of specific areas of concern by either the government or investment canada but added they hope to have more information early this week
investment canada declined to comment on the reasons for the government decision
<unk>:viren mehta a partner with mehta & <unk>:isaly a new york-based pharmaceutical industry research firm said the government 's ruling was n't unexpected
this has become a very <unk>:politicized deal concerning canada 's only large <unk>:world-class <unk>:bio-research or pharmaceutical company mr. mehta said
mr. mehta said the move that could allow the transaction to go ahead as planned could be an <unk>:out-of-court settlement of connaught 's dispute with the university of toronto
the university is seeking to block the acquisition of connaught by foreign interests citing concerns about the amount of research that would be done in canada
the university is considering a settlement proposal made by connaught
while neither side will disclose its <unk>:contents mr. mehta expects it to contain more specific guarantees on research and development spending levels in canada than merieux offered to investment canada
some analysts such as murray <unk>:grossner of toronto-based <unk>:richardson <unk>:greenshields inc. believe the government ruling leaves the door open for other bidders such as switzerland 's ciba-geigy and chiron corp. of <unk>:emeryville calif
officials for the two concerns which are bidding c$ N a share for connaught could n't be reached for comment
french state-owned rhone-poulenc s.a. holds N of merieux

the company said it planned to offer an <unk>:undetermined number of common shares in exchange for the N shares of its preferred stock outstanding
the exchange ratio was never established

the <unk>:energy-services concern said however that in january N it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock
<unk>:weatherford suspended its <unk>:preferred-dividend payment in october N and said it has n't any plans to catch up on dividends in <unk>:arrears about $ N million but will do so some time in the future
additionally the company said it filed with the securities and exchange commission for the proposed offering of N million shares of common stock expected to be offered in november
the company said salomon brothers inc. and howard weil <unk>:labouisse <unk>:friedrichs inc. underwriters for the offering were granted an option to buy as much as an additional N million shares to cover <unk>:over-allotments
proceeds will be used to eliminate and restructure bank debt

earnings for most of the nation 's major pharmaceutical makers are believed to have moved ahead <unk>:briskly in the third quarter as companies with newer <unk>:big-selling prescription drugs fared especially well
for the third consecutive quarter however most of the companies ' revenues were battered by adverse foreign-currency <unk>:translations as a result of the strong dollar abroad
analysts said that merck & co. eli lilly & co. warner-lambert co. and the squibb corp. unit of bristol-myers squibb co. all benefited from strong sales of relatively new <unk>:higher-priced <unk>:medicines that provide wide profit margins
less robust earnings at pfizer inc. and upjohn co. were attributed to those companies ' older products many of which face <unk>:stiffening competition from generic drugs and other <unk>:medicines
joseph <unk>:riccardo an analyst with bear stearns & co. said that over the past few years most drug makers have shed their <unk>:slow-growing businesses and instituted other cost savings such as consolidating manufacturing plants and administrative staffs
as a result major new products are having significant impact even on a company with very large revenues mr. <unk>:riccardo said
analysts said profit for the dozen or so big drug makers as a group is estimated to have climbed between N and N
while that 's not spectacular neil <unk>:sweig an analyst with prudential <unk>:bache said that the rate of growth will look especially good as compared to other companies if the economy turns downward
mr. <unk>:sweig estimated that merck 's profit for the quarter rose by about N propelled by sales of its <unk>:line-up of fast-growing prescription drugs including its <unk>:anti-cholesterol drug <unk>:mevacor a high blood pressure medicine <unk>:vasotec <unk>:primaxin an <unk>:antibiotic and <unk>:pepcid an <unk>:anti-ulcer medication
profit climbed even though merck 's sales were reduced by one to three percentage points as a result of the strong dollar mr. <unk>:sweig said
in the third quarter of N merck earned $ N million or N cents a share
in <unk>:rahway n.j. a merck spokesman said the company does n't make earnings projections
mr. <unk>:sweig said he estimated that lilly 's earnings for the quarter jumped about N largely because of the performance of its new <unk>:anti-depressant <unk>:prozac
the drug introduced last year is expected to generate sales of about $ N million this year
it 's turning out to be a real blockbuster mr. <unk>:sweig said
in last year 's third quarter lilly earned $ N million or $ N a share
in indianapolis lilly declined comment
several analysts said they expected warner-lambert 's profit also to increase by more than N from $ N million or $ N a share it reported in the like period last year
the company is praised by analysts for sharply lowering its costs in recent years and shedding numerous companies with low profit margins
the company 's lean operation analysts said allowed <unk>:sharp-rising sales from its cholesterol drug <unk>:lopid to power earnings growth
<unk>:lopid sales are expected to be about $ N million this year up from $ N million in N
in morris plains n.j. a spokesman for the company said the analysts ' projections are in the <unk>:ballpark
squibb 's profit estimated by analysts to be about N above the $ N million or $ N a share it earned in the third quarter of N was the result of especially strong sales of its <unk>:capoten drug for treating high blood pressure and other heart disease
the company was officially merged with bristol-myers co. earlier this month
bristol-myers declined to comment
mr. <unk>:riccardo of bear stearns said that schering-plough corp. 's expected profit rise of about N to N and <unk>:bristol-meyers 's expected profit increase of about N are largely because those companies are really managed well
<unk>:scheringplough earned $ N million or N cents a share while bristol-myers earned $ N million or N cents a share in the like period a year earlier
in madison n.j. a spokesman for schering-plough said the company has no problems with the average estimate by a analysts that third-quarter earnings per share rose by about N to $ N

meanwhile analysts said pfizer 's recent string of lackluster quarterly performances continued as earnings in the quarter were expected to decline by about N
sales of pfizer 's important drugs <unk>:feldene for treating <unk>:arthritis and <unk>:procardia a heart medicine have <unk>:shrunk because of increased competition

in new york the company declined comment
analysts said they expected upjohn 's profit to be flat or rise by only about N to N as compared with $ N million or N cents a share it earned a year ago
upjohn 's <unk>:biggest-selling drugs are <unk>:xanax a <unk>:tranquilizer and <unk>:halcion a <unk>:sedative
sales of both drugs have been hurt by new state laws restricting the <unk>:prescriptions of certain <unk>:tranquilizing <unk>:medicines and adverse publicity about the excessive use of the drugs
also the company 's <unk>:hair-growing drug <unk>:rogaine is selling well at about $ N million for the year but the company 's profit from the drug has been reduced by upjohn 's expensive print and television campaigns for advertising analysts said

gulf resources & chemical corp. said it agreed to pay $ N million as part of an accord with the environmental protection agency regarding an environmental cleanup of a <unk>:defunct <unk>:smelter the company formerly operated in idaho
in N the epa notified gulf resources which was a <unk>:part-owner of the <unk>:smelter that it was potentially liable for sharing cleanup costs at the site under the federal superfund program
the <unk>:21-square-mile area is <unk>:contaminated with lead <unk>:zinc and other metals
gulf resources earlier this year proposed a reorganization plan that would make it a unit of a <unk>:bermuda concern potentially <unk>:exempting it from liability for the <unk>:smelter 's cleanup costs
the company said that as part of its agreement with the epa it made certain voluntary <unk>:undertakings with respect to <unk>:intercorporate transactions entered into after the reorganization
the company which issued a statement on the agreement late friday said that $ N million of the payment was previously provided for in its financial statements and that $ N will be recognized in its N third-quarter statement
the agreement and consent <unk>:decree are subject to court approval the company said
gulf resources added that it will seek to recover equitable contribution from others for both the amount of the settlement and any other liabilities it may incur under the superfund law
under the agreement gulf must give the u.s. government N days ' advance written notice before issuing any dividends on common stock
the company 's net worth can not fall below $ N million after the dividends are issued
the terms of that agreement only become effective the date of gulf 's reorganization which we anticipate will occur sometime in early N said lawrence r. mehl gulf 's general counsel
in addition gulf must give the government N days ' advance written notice of any loans exceeding $ N million that are made to the <unk>:bermuda-based holding company
gulf 's net worth after those transaction must be at least $ N million
separately the company said it expects to hold a special meeting for shareholders in early N to vote on its proposed reorganization
many of the nation 's <unk>:highest-ranking executives <unk>:saluted friday 's market plunge as an overdue <unk>:comeuppance for speculators and takeover players
assuming that the market does n't head into a <unk>:bottomless free fall some executives think friday 's action could prove a <unk>:harbinger of good news as a sign that the leveraged buy-out and takeover frenzy of recent years may be <unk>:abating
this is a reaction to <unk>:artificial lbo <unk>:valuations rather than to any fundamentals said john young chairman of hewlett-packard co. whose shares dropped $ N to $ N
if we get rid of a lot of that nonsense it will be a big plus
a few of the executives here for the fall meeting of the business council a group that meets to discuss national issues were only too happy to <unk>:personalize their criticism
people wish the government would do something about leveraged buy-outs do something about takeovers do something about donald trump said rand <unk>:araskog chairman of itt corp. whose stock dropped $ N
where 's the leadership
where 's the guy who can say enough is enough '
the executives were <unk>:remarkably <unk>:unperturbed by the plunge even though it <unk>:lopped billions of dollars off the value of their companies and millions off their personal fortunes
i 'm not going to worry about one day 's decline said kenneth <unk>:olsen digital equipment corp. president who was <unk>:leisurely <unk>:strolling through the bright orange and yellow leaves of the <unk>:mountains here after his company 's shares plunged $ N to close at $ N
i did n't bother calling anybody i did n't even turn on tv
there has n't been any fundamental change in the economy added john <unk>:smale whose procter & gamble co. took an $ N slide to close at $ N
the fact that this happened two years ago and there was a recovery gives people some comfort that this wo n't be a problem
of course established corporate <unk>:managements often tend to <unk>:applaud the setbacks of stock speculators and takeover artists
indeed one chief executive who was downright <unk>:delighted by friday 's events was robert crandall chairman of amr corp. the parent of american airlines and the target of a takeover offer by mr. trump
asked whether friday 's action could help him avoid being <unk>:trumped by the new york real estate <unk>:magnate mr. crandall <unk>:smiled broadly and said no comment
on friday morning before the market 's sell-off the business leaders issued a report predicting the economy would grow at roughly an inflation-adjusted N annual rate through next year then accelerate <unk>:anew in N

the real estate slump that 's pushing down the price of new york office space and housing is also affecting the city 's retail real estate market
in manhattan <unk>:once-desirable store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill
retail real estate brokers say tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy turmoil in their own industries and a belief that <unk>:rents have not yet hit bottom
there is an <unk>:unbelievable amount of space available says faith <unk>:consolo senior vice president at <unk>:garrick-aug associates store leasing inc
there are about N stores for rent up from a more typical range of N to N
this further <unk>:confuses retailers she says
they wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down
is this the wrong time to open a store
who is going to be in the space next door
in addition ms. <unk>:consolo says tenants usually can negotiate to pay <unk>:rents that are about <unk>:one-quarter lower than <unk>:landlords ' initial asking price
a handful of hot retail locations such as the <unk>:57th street and madison and fifth avenue areas have been able to sustain what many see as <unk>:astronomical <unk>:rents
and in some neighborhoods <unk>:rents have merely hit a <unk>:plateau
but on average manhattan retail <unk>:rents have dropped N to N in the past six months alone experts say
that follows a more <unk>:subtle decline in the prior six months after manhattan <unk>:rents had run up rapidly since N
the same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing
as businesses contract or <unk>:depart the number of employees who might use retail services <unk>:shrinks says edward a. <unk>:friedman senior vice president of helmsley <unk>:spear inc
he says financial problems <unk>:plaguing electronics fur and furniture companies key categories in the local retail economy have further <unk>:deflated the market
hardest hit are what he calls secondary sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents
in these locations mr. <unk>:friedman says retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and <unk>:rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined
weakness in the restaurant industry which is leaving retail space vacant <unk>:exacerbates the problem for <unk>:landlords
it is also no comfort to <unk>:landlords and small new york retailers when the future of larger department stores which <unk>:anchor retail neighborhoods are in doubt
hooker corp. parent of <unk>:bonwit teller and b. altman 's is mired in bankruptcy proceedings and bloomingdale 's is for sale by its owner campeau corp
the trend toward lower <unk>:rents may seem surprising given that some communities in new york are <unk>:bemoaning the loss of favorite local businesses to high <unk>:rents
but despite the recent softening for many of these retailers there 's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s when their leases were signed
certainly the recent drop in prices does n't mean manhattan comes cheap
new york retail <unk>:rents still run well above the going rate in other u.s. cities
madison and fifth <unk>:avenues and east <unk>:57th street can command <unk>:rents of up to $ N a square foot and $ N is not uncommon
the thriving <unk>:34th street area offers <unk>:rents of about $ N a square foot as do <unk>:up-and-coming locations along lower fifth avenue
by contrast <unk>:rentals in the best retail locations in boston san francisco and chicago rarely top $ N a square foot
and <unk>:rents on beverly hills ' <unk>:rodeo drive generally do n't exceed about $ N a square foot

when justice william <unk>:brennan marks the start of his <unk>:34th year on the supreme court today the occasion will differ sharply from previous <unk>:anniversaries of his tenure
for the first time the <unk>:83-year-old justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent rather than as a force in the high court 's majority
this role reversal holds true as well for his three liberal and moderate allies justices <unk>:thurgood marshall harry <unk>:blackmun and john stevens
but are these four players three of them in their <unk>:80s ready to assume a different role after N years <unk>:collectively of service on the high court
every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role and the <unk>:frustrations that go with it but in different ways
justices <unk>:brennan and stevens appear <unk>:philosophical about it justices marshall and <unk>:blackmun appear fighting mad
the four justices are no newcomers to dissent often joining forces in the past decade to <unk>:criticize the court 's conservative <unk>:drift
but always in years past they have <unk>:bucked the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to <unk>:eke out a number of major victories in civil rights and <unk>:liberties cases
now however as the court 's new <unk>:five-member conservative majority continues to <unk>:solidify victories for the liberals are rare
the change is most dramatic for justice <unk>:brennan the last <unk>:survivor of the <unk>:mid-1960s liberal majority under chief justice <unk>:earl warren
in the seven supreme court terms from the fall of N through the spring of N the <unk>:height of the warren court 's power justice <unk>:brennan cast only N <unk>:dissenting votes in N cases decided by the court
last term alone he cast N <unk>:dissenting votes in N decisions with the contentious <unk>:flag-burning ruling as his only big victory
but justice <unk>:brennan <unk>:foresaw his new role strongly defending the importance of <unk>:dissents in a N speech
each time the court <unk>:revisits an issue the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to <unk>:rethink the result he said
moreover in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s he knew that the tables might turn in the future
he has said that he now knows how justice john <unk>:harlan felt a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent <unk>:dissenter from the warren court 's opinions
associates of <unk>:81-year-old justice marshall say he was depressed about the court 's direction last spring but is <unk>:feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the court 's cutbacks in civil rights
we could sweep it under the <unk>:rug and hide it but i 'm not going to do it he said in a speech last month
he like justice <unk>:brennan considers <unk>:dissents highly important for the future a point that has n't escaped legal scholars
harvard law school professor laurence tribe says there is a <unk>:generation-skipping flavor to current <unk>:dissents
the <unk>:dissenters in the warren court he says appeared to be writing for the short-term suggesting that the court 's direction might change soon
<unk>:brennan and marshall are speaking in their <unk>:dissents to a more distant future he says
justice <unk>:blackmun who will turn N next month also seems <unk>:feisty about his new role
associates say he takes some <unk>:defeats more personally than his colleagues especially attempts to curtail the right to abortion first recognized in his N opinion roe vs. wade
friends and associates who saw justice <unk>:blackmun during the summer said he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years
and his outlook improved after successful <unk>:cataract surgery in august
but his level of frustration showed in a recent <unk>:impassioned speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in chicago
he concluded his remarks by <unk>:quoting <unk>:emotionally and at some length according to those present the late martin <unk>:luther king 's famous i have a dream speech from the N march on washington
justice stevens N is probably the most <unk>:philosophical of the <unk>:dissenters about his role in part because he may be the least liberal of the four but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others
if the role these four <unk>:dissenters are assuming is a familiar one in modern supreme court history it also <unk>:differs in an important way from recent history court watchers say
the <unk>:dissenters of the warren court were often defending a legal <unk>:legacy that they inherited says prof. <unk>:a.e. dick howard of the university of virginia law school but the <unk>:dissenters today are defending a <unk>:legacy that they created
the government sold the deposits of four savings-and-loan institutions in its first wave of sales of big sick thrifts but low bids prevented the sale of a fifth
the four s&ls were sold to large banks as was the case with most of the N previous transactions initiated by the resolution trust corp. since it was created in the s&l bailout legislation two months ago
two of the four big thrifts were sold to ncnb corp. charlotte n.c. which has aggressively expanded its markets particularly in texas and florida
a canadian bank bought another thrift in the first rtc transaction with a foreign bank
under these deals the rtc sells just the deposits and the healthy assets
these <unk>:clean-bank transactions leave the bulk of bad assets mostly real estate with the government to be sold later
in these four for instance the rtc is stuck with $ N billion in bad assets
<unk>:acquirers paid premiums ranging from N to N for the deposits and branch systems roughly in line with what analysts were expecting
the buyers will also be locked into deposit rates for just two weeks as has been the case with previous deals
after that the buyers may <unk>:repudiate the rates paid by the former thrifts
but it 's uncertain whether these institutions will take those steps
ncnb for example has been one of the highest rate <unk>:payers in the texas market and in florida rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities
the rtc had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines but the delays illustrate the tough <unk>:chore facing the agency
these thrifts are <unk>:beached <unk>:whales said <unk>:bert <unk>:ely an industry consultant based in <unk>:alexandria va
for example the delay in selling people 's heritage savings <unk>:salina kan. with $ N billion in assets has forced the rtc to consider selling off the thrift <unk>:branch-by-branch instead of as a whole institution
ncnb continued its <unk>:foray into the florida and texas markets
ncnb will acquire university federal savings association houston which had assets of $ N billion
ncnb texas national bank will pay the rtc a premium of $ N million for $ N billion in deposits
as a measure of the <unk>:depths to which the texas real estate market has <unk>:sunk the rtc will pay $ N billion to ncnb to take $ N million of bad assets
ncnb also acquired freedom savings & loan association tampa fla. which had total assets of $ N million
ncnb will pay the rtc a premium of $ N million for $ N billion in deposits
ncnb will also acquire $ N million of freedom 's assets from the rtc which will require $ N million in assistance
meridian bancorp inc. reading pa. will acquire hill financial savings association red hill pa. which had $ N billion in assets
meridian will pay a premium of $ N million to assume $ N billion in deposits

time magazine in a move to reduce the costs of wooing new subscribers is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise <unk>:giveaways
in an announcement to its staff last week executives at time warner inc. 's weekly magazine said time will dramatically <unk>:de-emphasize its use of electronic <unk>:giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by N to four million and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $ N to $ N
in a related development the <unk>:news-weekly for the fourth year in a row said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in N a full <unk>:four-color page in the magazine costs about $ N
however because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered ad rates will be effectively N higher per subscriber according to richard <unk>:heinemann time associate publisher
time is following the course of some other <unk>:mass-circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing <unk>:myth that maintaining artificially high and expensive <unk>:circulations is the way to draw advertisers
in recent years reader 's digest new york times co. 's mccall 's and most recently news corp. 's tv guide have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers
deep discounts in <unk>:subscriptions and offers of free <unk>:clock <unk>:radios and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the <unk>:hyper-competitive world of magazine <unk>:news-weeklies
but time as part of the more <unk>:cost-conscious time warner wants to <unk>:wean itself away from expensive <unk>:gimmicks
besides time executives think selling a news magazine with a <unk>:clock radio is <unk>:tacky
<unk>:giveaways just give people the wrong image said mr. <unk>:heinemann
that perception takes the focus off the magazine
time magazine executives predictably <unk>:paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers
what we are doing is <unk>:screening out the readers who are only <unk>:casually related to the magazine and do n't really read it said mr. <unk>:heinemann
we are trying to create quality and involvement
however time executives used the same explanation when in october N the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from N million to N million
and time 's paid circulation according to audit bureau of <unk>:circulations dropped N to N in the six months ended june N N
still time 's move is being received well once again
it 's <unk>:terrific for advertisers to know the reader will be paying more said michael <unk>:drexler national media director at bozell inc. ad agency
a few drops in circulation are of no consequence
it 's not a show of weakness they are improving the quality of circulation while <unk>:insuring their profits
mr. <unk>:heinemann said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry a magazine 's net revenue per subscriber or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away
the question is how much are we getting from each reader said mr. <unk>:heinemann
time 's rivals <unk>:news-weeklies washington post co. 's newsweek and u.s. news & world report are less <unk>:reliant on electronic <unk>:giveaways and in recent years both have been increasing their circulation rate bases
both magazines are expected to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for N within a month

they said follow <unk>:cnn ' he told reporters
that shows how far ted turner 's cable news network has come since its birth nine years ago when it was considered the <unk>:laughingstock of television news
it is bigger faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks
its niche as the network of record during major crises draws elite audiences around the world
but for all its success <unk>:cnn has hit a <unk>:plateau
although <unk>:viewership <unk>:soars when big news breaks it <unk>:ebbs during periods of calm

just the fact we 're on N hours is no longer <unk>:bulletin says ed turner <unk>:cnn 's executive vice president news gathering and no <unk>:relation to ted turner
you ca n't live on that
so <unk>:cnn a unit of atlanta-based turner broadcasting system inc. is trying to <unk>:reposition itself as a primary channel or what people in the television industry call a top of mind network
tonight to kick off the effort <unk>:cnn will premiere its first prime-time <unk>:newscast in years an <unk>:hourlong show at N p.m <unk>:. eastern time to air <unk>:head-to-head against the network <unk>:newscasts
the show will be <unk>:co-anchored by bernard shaw and <unk>:catherine <unk>:crier a <unk>:34-year-old former texas judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism
the new show is perhaps the <unk>:boldest in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more <unk>:full-length signature programming with <unk>:recognizable stars
to <unk>:distinguish itself <unk>:cnn is also expanding international coverage and adding a second <unk>:global-news program
it is paying higher salaries after years of <unk>:scrimping to lure and keep experienced staffers

the next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables says jon <unk>:petrovich executive vice president of headline news <unk>:cnn 's sister network
but that wo n't be easy
networks like other consumer products develop images in peoples ' minds that are n't easy to change
it also takes money that <unk>:cnn has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see
and the cable-tv operators <unk>:cnn 's distributors and part owners like things just the way they are
the <unk>:repositioning bid is aimed at <unk>:cnn 's <unk>:unsteady <unk>:viewership and what may happen to it as the cable-tv news market grows more competitive
already <unk>:cnn is facing stronger competition from financial news network inc. and general electric co. 's consumer news and business channel both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future
in addition many cable-tv systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast stations
<unk>:cnn wants to change its viewers ' habits
its watchers are on the whole a <unk>:disloyal group of <unk>:channel-zapping <unk>:grazers and news <unk>:junkies who spend an average of just N minutes a day watching <unk>:cnn according to audience research
that 's less than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks
the brief attention viewers give <unk>:cnn could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data and advertising become more important to cable-tv channels
<unk>:cnn 's <unk>:viewer habits have been <unk>:molded by its format
its strategy in the past has been to serve as a tv wire service
it focused on building up its news bureaus around the world so as events took place it could go live <unk>:quicker and longer than other networks
it filled its daily schedule with <unk>:newscasts called <unk>:daybreak <unk>:daywatch <unk>:newsday and <unk>:newsnight but the shows <unk>:varied little in content <unk>:personality or look
now the push is on for <unk>:more-distinctive shows
our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity says paul <unk>:amos <unk>:cnn executive vice president for programming
<unk>:accordingly <unk>:cnn is adding a <unk>:world-affairs show in the morning because surveys show its <unk>:global-news hour in the afternoon is among its most <unk>:differentiated programs in viewers ' minds says mr. <unk>:amos
and it is exploring other original programs similar to its larry king live and <unk>:crossfire talk shows which executives hope will keep people <unk>:tuned in
then there 's the world today the prime-time <unk>:newscast featuring mr. shaw and ms. <unk>:crier
until now <unk>:cnn has featured its hollywood <unk>:gossip show during the key evening period
but N of the <unk>:cable-television-equipped households that watch news do so between N p.m. and N p.m. the network discovered so <unk>:cnn wants in
mr. <unk>:amos says the <unk>:shaw-crier team will probably do two live interviews a day with most of the program at least for now appearing similar to <unk>:cnn 's other <unk>:newcasts
some in the industry are skeptical
i find it hard to <unk>:conceive of people switching over to <unk>:cnn for what at least in the public 's mind is the same news says <unk>:reuven frank the former <unk>:two-time president of nbc news and <unk>:creator of the <unk>:huntley-brinkley report
the evening news is also slated as <unk>:cnn 's stage for its big push into <unk>:investigative journalism
in august the network hired <unk>:award-winning producer <unk>:pamela hill the former head of news <unk>:specials at abc
she 's <unk>:assembling a staff of about N <unk>:investigative reporters who will produce weekly <unk>:in-depth segments with an eye toward breaking big stories
<unk>:cnn executives hope the <unk>:headlines created by such <unk>:scoops will generate excitement for its <unk>:branded programs in the way N minutes did so well for cbs
that 's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical <unk>:cnn will follow through with its <unk>:investigative commitment especially after it sees the cost of producing <unk>:in-depth pieces
they 've never shown any <unk>:inclination to spend money on production says michael <unk>:mosettig a senior producer with <unk>:macneil-lehrer <unk>:newshour who notes that <unk>:cnn is <unk>:indispensable to his job
the network 's salaries have always ranged far below industry standards resulting in a <unk>:less-experienced work force
<unk>:cnn recently gave most employees raises of as much as N but they 're still drastically <unk>:underpaid compared with the networks
says mr. <unk>:mosettig <unk>:cnn is my wire service they 're on top of everything
but to improve they 've really got to make the investment in people
in any case <unk>:cable-tv-system operators have reason to fear any <unk>:tinkering with <unk>:cnn 's format
they market cable-tv on the very <unk>:grazing opportunities <unk>:cnn seeks to discourage
we would obviously be upset if those kinds of services <unk>:evolved into more <unk>:general-interest <unk>:long-format programming says robert <unk>:stengel senior vice president programming of continental <unk>:cablevision inc. which holds a N stake in turner broadcasting
the second u.s. circuit court of appeals opinion in the <unk>:arcadian <unk>:phosphate case did not <unk>:repudiate the position pennzoil co. took in its dispute with texaco contrary to your sept. N article court backs texaco 's view in pennzoil case too late
the fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend to be bound
in the <unk>:pennzoiltexaco litigation the courts found pennzoil and <unk>:getty oil intended to be bound in <unk>:arcadian <unk>:phosphates they found there was no intention to be bound
<unk>:admittedly the principle in the cases is the same
but the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts
and the facts as found by the various courts in these two lawsuits were different
when you suggest otherwise you leave the <unk>:realm of reporting and enter the <unk>:orbit of speculation

valley federal savings & loan association said imperial corp. of america withdrew from regulators its application to buy five valley federal branches leaving the transaction in limbo
the broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at imperial corp. whose spokesman said the company withdrew its application from the federal office of thrift supervision because of an informal notice that imperial 's thrift unit failed to meet community reinvestment act requirements
the community reinvestment act requires savings and loan associations to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposits are received
the transaction announced in august included about $ N million in deposits at the five outlets in california 's san <unk>:joaquin valley
terms were n't disclosed but valley federal had said it expected to post a modest pretax gain and to save about $ N million in operating costs annually
valley federal said friday that it is considering whether to seek another buyer for the branches or to pursue the transaction with imperial corp. which said it is attempting to meet community reinvestment act requirements
valley federal with assets of $ N billion is based in van <unk>:nuys
imperial corp. based in san diego is the parent of imperial savings & loan
in the first six months of the year it posted a net loss of $ N million
call it the we 're too broke to fight defense
lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new <unk>:tack in their efforts to <unk>:defuse suits filed by borrowers developers and creditors
the thrifts ' lawyers claim that the suits <unk>:numbering N to N in texas alone should be dismissed as <unk>:moot because neither the s&ls nor the <unk>:extinct federal savings and loan insurance corp. has the money to pay judgments
though the argument may have a <unk>:common-sense ring to it even the s&l lawyers concede there 's little precedent to back their position
still one federal appeals court has signaled it 's willing to <unk>:entertain the notion and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law
the dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court <unk>:dockets in texas and reducing the <unk>:fslic 's massive legal bills which topped $ N million last year
the s&l lawyers were encouraged last month by an <unk>:appellate-court ruling in two cases brought against <unk>:defunct <unk>:sunbelt savings & loan association of dallas by the developers of the valley ranch best known as the training center for the dallas cowboys football team
<unk>:sunbelt foreclosed on the ranch
<unk>:sunbelt and the <unk>:fslic argued to the fifth u.s. circuit court of appeals that there will never be any assets with which to satisfy a judgment against <unk>:sunbelt savings nor any means to collect from any other party including <unk>:fslic
if true the court wrote this <unk>:contention would justify dismissal of these actions on prudential grounds
but the court said it lacked enough financial information about <unk>:sunbelt and the <unk>:fslic and sent the cases back to federal district court in dallas
charles <unk>:haworth a lawyer for <unk>:sunbelt says he plans to file a brief this week urging the district judge to dismiss the suits because <unk>:sunbelt 's liabilities exceeded its assets by about $ N billion when federal regulators closed it in august N
this institution is just brain dead says mr. <unk>:haworth a partner in the dallas office of <unk>:andrews & <unk>:kurth a houston law firm
but a lawyer for <unk>:triland investment group the developer of valley ranch <unk>:dismisses such arguments as a defense du <unk>:jour
attorney richard jackson of dallas says a judgment for <unk>:triland could be satisfied in ways other than a monetary award including the reversal of <unk>:sunbelt 's <unk>:foreclosure on valley ranch
we 're asking the court for a number of things he can grant in addition to the <unk>:thrill of victory he says

a group of arby 's franchisees said they formed an association to oppose miami beach financier victor posner 's control of the restaurant chain
the decision is the latest move in an <unk>:escalating battle between the franchisees and mr. posner that began in august
at the time a group called <unk>:r.b. partners ltd. consisting of eight of arby 's largest franchisees offered more than $ N million to buy arby 's inc. which is part of <unk>:dwg corp

september 's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still <unk>:persists and the <unk>:pessimism over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market 's plunge friday
after falling for three consecutive months the producer price index for finished goods shot up N last month the labor department reported friday as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer
although the report which was released before the stock market opened did n't trigger the <unk>:N.58-point drop in the dow jones industrial average analysts said it did play a role in the market 's decline
analysts immediately viewed the price data the <unk>:grimmest inflation news in months as evidence that the federal reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped
further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the fed from easing credit the commerce department reported friday that retail sales grew N in september to $ N billion
that rise came on top of a N gain in august and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy
i think the friday report combined with the actions of the fed weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy said robert <unk>:dederick chief economist at northern trust co. in chicago
but economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers
the overall N increase is serious in itself but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy the producer price index still increased by N said gordon <unk>:richards an economist at the national association of manufacturers
but sung won <unk>:sohn chief economist at <unk>:norwest corp. in minneapolis blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the september jump
i would say this is not bad news this is a <unk>:blip he said
the core rate is not really out of line
all year energy prices have <unk>:skewed the producer price index which measures changes in the prices producers receive for goods
inflation <unk>:unquestionably has fallen back from its <unk>:torrid pace last winter when a steep <unk>:run-up in world oil prices sent the index surging at double-digit annual rates
energy prices then plummeted through the summer causing the index to decline for three consecutive months
overall the index has climbed at a N compound annual rate since the start of the year the labor department said
while far more <unk>:restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year that is still a <unk>:steeper rise than the N increase for all of N
moreover this year 's good inflation news may have ended last month when energy prices <unk>:zoomed up N after plunging N in august
some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain
analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index but the N climb was higher than most anticipated
i think the <unk>:resurgence in inflation is going to continue for a few months said john <unk>:mueller chief economist at bell <unk>:mueller <unk>:cannon a washington economic forecasting firm
he predicted that inflation will moderate next year saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide
but <unk>:dirk van <unk>:dongen president of the national association of <unk>:wholesaler-distributors said that last month 's rise is n't as bad an <unk>:omen as the N figure suggests
if you examine the data carefully the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods he explained
passenger car prices jumped N in september after climbing N in august and declining in the late spring and summer
many analysts said the september increase was a one-time event coming as dealers introduced their N models
although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations car prices rose beyond the <unk>:customary autumn increase
prices for capital equipment rose a hefty N in september while prices for home electronic equipment fell N
food prices declined N after climbing N in august
meanwhile the retail sales report showed that car sales rose N in september to $ N billion
but at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices analysts said
sales at general merchandise stores rose N after declining N in august while sales of building materials fell N after rising N
producer prices for intermediate goods grew N in september after dropping for three consecutive months
prices for crude goods an array of raw materials jumped N after declining N in august and <unk>:edging up N in july
here are the labor department 's producer price indexes N N for september before seasonal adjustment and the percentage changes from september N
<unk>:cityfed financial corp. said it expects to report a loss of at least $ N million to $ N million for the third quarter
in the year-earlier period <unk>:cityfed had net income of $ N but no per-share earnings
<unk>:cityfed 's president and chief executive officer john <unk>:atherton said the loss stems from several factors
he said nonperforming assets rose to slightly more than $ N million from $ N million between june and september
approximately N of the total <unk>:consisted of nonperforming commercial real estate assets
<unk>:accordingly <unk>:cityfed estimated that it will provide between $ N million and $ N million for credit losses in the third quarter
<unk>:cityfed added that significant additional loan-loss provisions may be required by federal regulators as part of the current annual examination of city federal savings bank <unk>:cityfed 's primary subsidiary based in <unk>:somerset n.j
city federal operates N banking offices in new jersey and florida
mr. <unk>:atherton said <unk>:cityfed will also mark its portfolio of high-yield corporate bonds to market as a result of federal legislation requiring that savings institutions <unk>:divest themselves of such bonds
that action <unk>:cityfed said will result in a charge against third-quarter results of approximately $ N million
<unk>:cityfed also said it expects to shed its remaining mortgage loan <unk>:origination operations outside its principal markets in new jersey and florida and as a result is taking a charge for discontinued operations
all these actions mr. <unk>:atherton said will result in a loss of $ N million to $ N million for the third quarter
he added however depending on the resolution of certain accounting issues relating to mortgages <unk>:servicing and the outcome of the annual examination of city federal currently in progress with respect to the appropriate level of loan loss reserves the total loss for the quarter could significantly exceed this range
centrust savings bank said federal thrift regulators ordered it to suspend dividend payments on its two classes of preferred stock indicating that regulators ' concerns about the troubled institution have heightened
in a statement miami-based centrust said the regulators cited the thrift 's operating losses and apparent losses in its junk-bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of the dividends
regulators also ordered centrust to stop buying back the preferred stock
david l. paul chairman and chief executive officer criticized the federal office of thrift supervision which issued the <unk>:directive saying it was inappropriate and based on insufficient reasons
he said the thrift will try to get regulators to reverse the decision
the suspension of a preferred stock dividend is a serious step that signals that regulators have deep concerns about an institution 's health
in march regulators labeled centrust a troubled institution largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses
in the same month the office of thrift supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track
for the nine months ended june N centrust had a net loss of $ N million compared with year-earlier net income of $ N million
centrust which is florida 's largest thrift holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation
since april it has <unk>:pared its high-yield bond holdings to about $ N million from $ N billion
mr. paul said only about $ N million of the current holdings are <unk>:tradeable securities registered with the securities and exchange commission
the remainder he said are commercial loan <unk>:participations or private <unk>:placements that are n't filed with the sec and do n't have a ready market
centrust and regulators have been in a dispute over market <unk>:valuations for the junk bonds
the office of thrift supervision has been <unk>:hounding centrust to provide current market values for its holdings but centrust has said it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative <unk>:illiquidity of the bonds and lack of a ready market
regulators have become increasingly <unk>:antsy about centrust 's and other thrifts ' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market
the legislation requires thrifts to <unk>:divest themselves of junk bonds in the new <unk>:somber regulatory climate
in american stock exchange composite trading friday centrust common shares closed at $ N down N cents
in a statement friday mr. paul challenged the regulators ' decision saying the thrift 's operating losses and apparent junk-bond losses have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank
he also said substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from the junk bonds
in the third quarter for instance centrust added $ N million to its general reserves
mr. paul said the regulators should instead move ahead with <unk>:approving centrust 's request to sell N of its N branches to great western bank a unit of great western financial corp. based in beverly hills calif
the branch sale is the centerpiece of centrust 's strategy to transform itself into a traditional s&l from a <unk>:high-flying institution that relied heavily on securities trading for profits according to mr. paul
most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction which was announced in july long before now
many interpret the delay as an indication that regulators are skeptical about the proposal
branches and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal regulators take over an institution
centrust however <unk>:touts the branch sale saying it would bring in $ N million and reduce the thrift 's assets to $ N billion from $ N billion
it said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of $ N million or about N of assets from a negative $ N million as of sept. N thus bringing centrust close to regulatory standards
centrust said the branch sale would also reduce the company 's large amount of good will by about $ N million
critics however say the branch sale will make centrust more dependent than ever on <unk>:brokered deposits and junk bonds
mr. paul <unk>:counters that he intends to further <unk>:pare the size of centrust by not renewing more than $ N billion of <unk>:brokered certificates of deposit when they come due
the thrift is also working to unload its junk-bond portfolio by continuing to sell off the bonds and it plans to eventually place some of them in a separate affiliate as required under the new thrift law
on a recent saturday night in the midst of west germany 's most popular prime-time show a <unk>:contestant bet the host that she could name any of N different <unk>:cheeses after just one <unk>:nibble while <unk>:blindfolded
the woman won the bet
but perhaps even more remarkable the <unk>:three-hour-show <unk>:wetten <unk>:dass make a bet regularly wins the top <unk>:slot in the country 's tv ratings sometimes drawing as many as N of west german households
as the N economic integration approaches europe 's cultural <unk>:curators have taken to the <unk>:ramparts against american cultural <unk>:imperialism threatening to impose quotas against such pop <unk>:invaders as dallas miami vice and l.a. law
but much of what the europeans want to protect seems every bit as <unk>:cheesy as what they are trying to keep out
the most <unk>:militant opposition to american tv imports has come from french television and movie producers who have demanded quotas ensuring that a full N of europe 's tv shows be produced in europe
so far the french have failed to win enough broad-based support to prevail
a <unk>:glance through the television listings and a few <unk>:twists of the european television dial suggest one reason why
while there are some popular action and drama series few <unk>:boast the high culture and <unk>:classy production values one might expect
more european air time is filled with <unk>:low-budget game shows variety hours movies and talk shows many of which are authorized <unk>:knock-offs of their american counterparts
one of france 's most popular saturday night programs features <unk>:semi-celebrities seeking out their <unk>:grammar-school <unk>:classmates for <unk>:on-air <unk>:reunions
a <unk>:flemish game show has as its host a belgian <unk>:pretending to be italian
one of italy 's favorite shows <unk>:fantastico a <unk>:tepid variety show is so popular that viewers <unk>:clamored to buy a <unk>:chocolate product <unk>:cacao <unk>:fantastico whose <unk>:praises were sung each week by <unk>:dancing <unk>:showgirls even though the product did n't exist
<unk>:topping the <unk>:cheese <unk>:stunt on another typical evening of fun on <unk>:wetten <unk>:dass a <unk>:contestant won a bet with the show 's host thomas <unk>:gottschalk that he could identify N german <unk>:dialects over the telephone
a celebrity guest u.s. ambassador to west germany richard burt also won a bet that someone could pile up $ N worth of quarters on a <unk>:slanted coin
mr. burt nonetheless paid the penalty as if he had lost agreeing to spend a day with west german foreign minister <unk>:hans-dietrich <unk>:genscher <unk>:frying and selling their combined weight in potato <unk>:pancakes
if this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise the <unk>:protectionist barriers it may be because these shows need all the protection they can get
european programs usually target only their own local audience and often only a small portion of that
<unk>:mega-hits in germany or italy rarely make it even to france or great britain and almost never show up on u.s. screens
attempts to produce <unk>:pan-european programs have generally resulted in disappointment
one annual <unk>:co-production the <unk>:three-hour-long <unk>:eurovision song contest featuring <unk>:soft-rock <unk>:songs from each of N european countries has been described as the world 's most boring tv show
another <unk>:jeux <unk>:sans <unk>:frontieres where <unk>:villagers from <unk>:assorted european countries make <unk>:fools of themselves performing <unk>:pointless tasks is a hit in france
a <unk>:u.s.-made <unk>:imitation under the title almost anything goes <unk>:flopped fast
for the most part what 's made here stays here and for good reason
the <unk>:cream of the british crop the literary <unk>:dramas that are shown on u.s. public television as <unk>:masterpiece theater make up a relatively small part of british air time
most british programming is more of an acquired taste
there is for instance one man and his dog a <unk>:herding contest among sheep dogs
also <unk>:riveting to the british are hours of <unk>:dart-throwing <unk>:championships even more hours of lawn bowling <unk>:contests and still more hours of <unk>:snooker <unk>:marathons
european drama has had better though still mixed fortunes
the most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns
a french <unk>:knock-off of dallas called <unk>:chateauvallon and set in a french <unk>:vineyard had a good run in france which ended after the female lead was injured in a <unk>:real-life auto accident
<unk>:schwarzwaldklinik black forest clinic a kind of german <unk>:st <unk>:. elsewhere set in a health <unk>:spa is popular in germany and has spread into france
italy 's most popular series is a drama called la <unk>:piovra or the <unk>:octopus which <unk>:chronicles the fight of an <unk>:idealistic young investigator in <unk>:palermo against the mafia
it was <unk>:front-page news in italy earlier this year when the <unk>:fictional inspector was <unk>:gunned down in the series
spain 's most popular <unk>:mini-series this year was <unk>:juncal the story of an aging <unk>:bullfighter
the trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular with american programs second says brian <unk>:wenham a former director of programs for the british broadcasting corp
given a choice everybody will watch a <unk>:home-produced show
but frequently there is n't much choice
thus europe has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy shows of its own programs with broader appeal
we 've basically got to start from <unk>:scratch to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see concedes <unk>:colin young head of britain 's national film theatre school
while some in the u.s. contend that advertising is the <unk>:bane of television here many believe that its absence is to blame for the european tv industry 's sluggish development
until recently national governments in europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising
since production costs were guaranteed it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into <unk>:syndication as most american programs are
but not much money was spent on the shows either a situation that encouraged <unk>:cheap-to-make talk and game shows while discouraging <unk>:expensive-to-produce <unk>:dramas
now however commercial channels are coming to most european countries and at the same time satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly
just last week greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time spain earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state channels

british aerospace plc and france 's <unk>:thomson-csf s.a. said they are <unk>:nearing an agreement to merge their <unk>:guided-missile divisions greatly expanding collaboration between the two defense contractors
the <unk>:50-N joint venture which may be dubbed <unk>:eurodynamics would have combined annual sales of at least # N billion $ N billion and would be among the world 's largest missile makers
after two years of talks plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek french and british government clearance
the companies hope for a final agreement by year-end
the venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies and help make them a leading force in european defense contracting
in recent months a string of cross-border mergers and joint ventures have <unk>:reshaped the <unk>:once-balkanized world of european arms manufacture
already british aerospace and french <unk>:government-controlled <unk>:thomson-csf <unk>:collaborate on a british missile contract and on an <unk>:air-traffic control radar system
just last week they announced they may make a joint bid to buy ferranti international signal plc a smaller british defense contractor rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a u.s. unit
the sudden <unk>:romance of british aerospace and <unk>:thomson-csf traditionally bitter competitors for middle east and third world weapons contracts is <unk>:stirring controversy in western europe 's defense industry
most threatened by closer british <unk>:aerospace-thomson ties would be their respective national rivals including <unk>:matra s.a. in france and britain 's general electric co. plc
but neither <unk>:matra nor <unk>:gec unrelated to stamford <unk>:conn.-based general electric co. are sitting quietly by as their competitors join forces
yesterday a source close to <unk>:gec confirmed that his company may join the ferranti fight as part of a possible consortium that would bid against british aerospace and <unk>:thomson-csf
companies with which <unk>:gec has had talks about a possible joint ferranti bid include <unk>:matra britain 's <unk>:dowty group plc west germany 's daimler-benz ag and france 's dassault group
but it may be weeks before <unk>:gec and its potential partners decide whether to bid the source indicated
<unk>:gec plans first to study ferranti 's financial accounts which auditors recently said included # N million in <unk>:fictitious contracts at a u.s. unit international signal & control group with which ferranti merged last year
also any <unk>:gec bid might be blocked by british antitrust regulators ferranti is <unk>:gec 's main competitor on several key <unk>:defense-electronics contracts and its purchase by <unk>:gec may <unk>:heighten british defense ministry worries about concentration in the country 's defense industry
a consortium bid however would <unk>:diminish <unk>:gec 's direct role in ferranti and might consequently <unk>:appease ministry officials
a british aerospace spokeswoman appeared <unk>:unperturbed by the prospect of a fight with <unk>:gec for ferranti competition is the name of the game she said
at least one potential <unk>:gec partner <unk>:matra insists it is n't interested in ferranti
we have nothing to say about this affair which does n't concern us a <unk>:matra official said sunday
the missile venture the british aerospace spokeswoman said is a needed response to the new environment in defense contracting
for both thomson and british aerospace earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly <unk>:tight-fisted defense ministries and middle east sales a traditional mainstay for both companies ' exports have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices
the venture 's importance for thomson is great
thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other europeans
the european defense industry is consolidating for instance west germany 's siemens ag recently joined <unk>:gec in a takeover of britain 's <unk>:plessey co. and daimler-benz agreed to buy <unk>:messerschmitt-boelkow <unk>:blohm g.m.b <unk>:. <unk>:h
in missiles thomson is already <unk>:overshadowed by british aerospace and by its home rival france 's <unk>:aerospatiale s.a. to better compete thomson officials say they need a partnership
to justify <unk>:50-N ownership of the planned venture thomson would make a cash payment to british aerospace
annual revenue of british aerospace 's missile business is about # N million a thomson spokesman said
british aerospace 's chief missile products include its <unk>:17-year-old family of <unk>:rapier <unk>:surface-to-air missiles
thomson missile products with about half british aerospace 's annual revenue include the <unk>:crotale <unk>:surface-to-air missile family
<unk>:interprovincial pipe line co. said it will delay a proposed <unk>:two-step N million <unk>:canadian-dollar us$ N million expansion of its system because canada 's output of crude oil is shrinking
<unk>:interprovincial canada 's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major <unk>:transporter of crude to the u.s. said revised industry forecasts indicate that canadian oil output will total about N million barrels a day by N N lower than a previous estimate
canadian crude production averaged about N million barrels a day during N 's first half about N below the N level
the capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas said ronald <unk>:watkins vice president for government and industry relations with <unk>:interprovincial 's parent <unk>:interhome energy inc
mr. <unk>:watkins said volume on <unk>:interprovincial 's system is down about N since january and is expected to fall further making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s
there has been a swing of the <unk>:pendulum back to the gas side he said
many of canada 's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil and have shifted their exploration and development budgets <unk>:accordingly
the number of active drilling <unk>:rigs in canada is down N from a year ago and the number of completed oil wells is down more than that due to the increasing focus on gas exploration said robert <unk>:feick manager of crude oil with calgary 's independent petroleum association of canada an industry group
mr. <unk>:watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature conventional fields in western canada
<unk>:interprovincial <unk>:transports about N of all crude produced in western canada and almost N of <unk>:interprovincial 's total volume consists of light crude
nearly all of the crude oil that canada exports to the u.s. is <unk>:transported on <unk>:interprovincial 's system whose main line runs from <unk>:edmonton to major u.s. and canadian cities in the great <unk>:lakes region including chicago <unk>:buffalo toronto and montreal
canada 's current oil exports to the u.s. total about N barrels a day or about N of net u.s. crude imports said john <unk>:lichtblau president of the new york-based petroleum industry research foundation
that ranks canada as the <unk>:fourth-largest source of imported crude behind saudi arabia <unk>:nigeria and mexico
mr. <unk>:lichtblau said canada 's declining crude output combined with the <unk>:fast-shrinking output of u.s. crude will help intensify u.s. reliance on oil from overseas particularly the middle east
it 's very much a growing concern
but when something is inevitable you learn to live with it he said
mr. <unk>:lichtblau stressed that the delay of <unk>:interprovincial 's proposed expansion wo n't by itself increase u.s. <unk>:dependence on offshore crude however since canadian imports are limited in any case by canada 's falling output
under terms of its proposed <unk>:two-step expansion which would have required regulatory approval <unk>:interprovincial intended to add N barrels a day of additional capacity to its system beginning with a modest expansion by N
the system currently has a capacity of N million barrels a day
inland steel industries inc. expects to report that third-quarter earnings dropped more than N from the previous quarter as a result of reduced sales volume and increased costs
in the second quarter the steelmaker had net income of $ N million or $ N a share including a pretax charge of $ N million related to the settlement of a suit on sales of $ N billion
the company said normal seasonal softness and lost orders caused by prolonged labor talks reduced shipments by N tons in the latest quarter compared with the second quarter
at the same time the <unk>:integrated-steel business was hurt by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses as well as higher labor costs under its new contract
the <unk>:service-center business was hurt by reduced margins and start-up costs associated with its joseph t. <unk>:ryerson & son unit
the company said it is beginning to see some <unk>:shipping-rate improvements in both the <unk>:intergrated-steel and <unk>:steel-service-center segments which should result in improved results for the fourth quarter
inland said its third-quarter results will be announced later this week
in the year-earlier third quarter when the industry was in the midst of a boom the company had net of $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion
predicting the financial results of computer firms has been a tough job lately
take microsoft corp. the largest maker of personal computer software and generally considered an industry bellwether
in july the company stunned wall street with the prediction that growth in the personal computer business overall would be only N in N a modest increase when compared with the <unk>:sizzling expansion of years past
investors taking this as a sign that a broad industry slump was in the <unk>:offing reacted by selling the company 's stock which lost $ N that day to close at $ N in national over-the-counter trading
but that was all of three months ago
last week microsoft said it expects revenue for its first quarter ended sept. N to increase N
the announcement caused the company 's stock to surge $ N to close at $ N a share
microsoft 's surprising strength is one example of the difficulty facing investors looking for <unk>:reassurances about the financial health of the computer firms
it 's hard to know what to expect at this point said peter rogers an analyst at robertson <unk>:stephens & co
the industry <unk>:defies <unk>:characterization
to illustrate mr. rogers said that of the N <unk>:computer-related firms he follows half will report for their most recent quarter earnings below last year 's results and half above those results
among those companies expected to have a down quarter are hewlett-packard co. <unk>:amdahl corp. and sun microsystems inc. generally solid performers in the past
international business machines corp. also is expected to report disappointing results
apple computer inc. meanwhile is expected to show improved earnings for the period ended <unk>:sept
another <unk>:contradictory message comes from businessland inc. a computer retailer
in july the company reported that booming sales of new personal computers from apple and ibm had resulted in net income more than doubling for its fourth quarter ended june N to $ N million or N cents a share
this month however businessland warned investors that results for its first quarter ended sept. N had n't met expectations
the company said it expects earnings of N to N cents a share down from N cents a share in the year-earlier period
while the earnings picture <unk>:confuses observers say the major forces expected to shape the industry in the coming year are <unk>:clearer
companies will continue to war over standards
in computer publishing a battle over <unk>:typefaces is hurting adobe systems inc. which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays
until recently adobe had a lock on the market for image software but last month apple adobe 's biggest customer and microsoft <unk>:rebelled
now the two firms are <unk>:collaborating on an alternative to adobe 's approach and analysts say they are likely to carry ibm the biggest seller of personal computers along with them
the short-term outlook for adobe 's business however appears strong
the company is beginning to ship a new software program that 's being <unk>:heralded as a <unk>:boon for owners of <unk>:low-end printers sold by apple
the program is aimed at improving the quality of printed material
john <unk>:warnock adobe 's chief executive officer said the mountain view calif. company has been receiving N calls a day about the product since it was demonstrated at a computer publishing conference several weeks ago
meanwhile competition between various operating systems which control the basic functions of a computer <unk>:spells trouble for software firms generally
it creates uncertainty and usually <unk>:slows down sales said <unk>:russ <unk>:crabs an analyst at <unk>:soundview financial group
mr. <unk>:crabs said this probably is behind the expected weak performance of <unk>:aldus corp. maker of a widely used computer publishing program
he expects <unk>:aldus to report earnings of N cents a share on revenues of $ N million for its third quarter compared with earnings of N cents a share on revenue of N million in the year-earlier period
<unk>:aldus officials could n't be reached for comment
on the other hand the battle of the bus is expected to grow increasingly irrelevant
a bus is the data highway within a computer
ibm is backing one type of bus called <unk>:microchannel while the nine other leading computer makers including <unk>:h-p and compaq computer corp. have chosen another method
users do n't care about the bus said daniel benton an analyst at goldman sachs & co
he said apple 's family of <unk>:macintosh computers for instance uses four different buses and no one seems to mind
the gap between winners and <unk>:laggards will grow
in personal computers apple compaq and ibm are expected to tighten their hold on their business
at the same time <unk>:second-tier firms will continue to lose ground
some lagging competitors even may leave the personal computer business altogether
<unk>:wyse technology for instance is considered a candidate to sell its troubled operation
<unk>:wyse has done well establishing a distribution business but they have n't delivered products that sell said <unk>:kimball brown an analyst at prudential-bache securities
mr. brown estimates <unk>:wyse whose terminals business is strong will report a loss of N cents a share for its quarter ended <unk>:sept
personal-computer makers will continue to eat away at the business of more traditional computer firms
<unk>:ever-more powerful <unk>:desk-top computers designed with one or more microprocessors as their brains are expected to increasingly take on functions carried out by more expensive minicomputers and mainframes
the guys that make traditional hardware are really being <unk>:obsoleted by <unk>:microprocessor-based machines said mr. benton
as a result of this trend longtime <unk>:powerhouses <unk>:h-p ibm and digital equipment corp. are scrambling to <unk>:counterattack with <unk>:microprocessor-based systems of their own
but they will have to act quickly
mr. benton expects compaq to unveil a family of high-end personal computers later this year that are powerful enough to serve as the hub for communications within large networks of <unk>:desk-top machines
a <unk>:raft of new computer companies also has targeted this <unk>:server market
population drain ends for midwestern states
iowa is making a comeback
so are indiana ohio and michigan
the population of all four states is on the <unk>:upswing according to new census bureau estimates following declines throughout the early 1980s
the gains to be sure are rather small
iowa for instance saw its population grow by N people or N between N and N the census bureau says
still even that modest increase is good news for a state that had n't grown at all since N
between N and N north <unk>:dakota was the only state in the midwest to lose population a loss of N people
six of the N midwestern states have been growing steadily since N illinois kansas minnesota missouri south <unk>:dakota and wisconsin
the northeast has been holding its own in the population race
seven of nine states have grown each year since N including new york which lost N of its population during the 1970s
and although pennsylvania and massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade they are growing again
at the same time several states in the south and west have had their own population turnaround
seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population west virginia mississippi louisiana oklahoma <unk>:montana wyoming and alaska
overall though the south and west still <unk>:outpace the northeast and midwest and fast-growing states like florida and california ensure that the pattern will continue
but the growth gap between the sun belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing
more elderly maintain their independence
thanks to modern medicine more couples are growing old together
and even after losing a spouse more of the elderly are staying independent
a new census bureau study of the <unk>:noninstitutionalized population shows that N of people aged N to N were living with a spouse in N up from N in N
this does n't mean they 're less likely to live alone however
that share has remained at about N since N
what has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other <unk>:relatives such as children
in N N of those aged N to N lived with <unk>:relatives other than spouses down from N in N
as people get even older many become <unk>:widowed
but even among those aged N and older the share living with a spouse rose slightly to N in N from N in N
like their younger counterparts the older elderly are less likely to live with other <unk>:relatives
only N of those aged N and older lived with <unk>:relatives other than spouses in N down from N in N
the likelihood of living alone beyond the age of N has increased to N from N
more people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off <unk>:physically and financially
careers count most for the <unk>:well-to-do
many affluent people place personal success and money above family
at least that 's what a survey by ernst & young and <unk>:yankelovich <unk>:clancy <unk>:shulman indicates
two-thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families
being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group
unlike most studies of the affluent market this survey excluded the <unk>:super-rich
average household income for the sample was $ N and average net assets were reported as $ N
the goal was to learn about one of today 's fastest-growing income groups the <unk>:upper-middle class
although they represent only N of the population they control nearly one-third of discretionary income
across the board these consumers value quality buy what they like rather than just what they need and appreciate products that are distinctive
despite their considerable incomes and assets N of the respondents in the study do n't feel financially secure and <unk>:one-fourth do n't feel that they have made it
<unk>:twenty percent do n't even feel they are financially well off
many of the affluent are n't comfortable with themselves either
about N do n't feel they 're more able than others
while <unk>:twothirds feel some <unk>:guilt about being affluent only N give $ N or more to charity each year
<unk>:thirty-five percent attend <unk>:religious services regularly at the same time N feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one 's principles
odds and ends
the number of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation 's largest banks has more than doubled since N

the council 's action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim has been <unk>:maligned <unk>:unjustly for years

it would open a can of <unk>:worms

of all the ethnic <unk>:tensions in america which is the most troublesome right now
a good bet would be the tension between blacks and <unk>:jews in new york city
or so it must seem to <unk>:jackie mason the veteran jewish <unk>:comedian appearing in a new abc <unk>:sitcom airing on tuesday nights <unk>:930-N p.m. edt
not only is mr. mason the star of chicken soup he 's also the <unk>:inheritor of a <unk>:comedic tradition dating back to duck soup and he 's currently a man in hot water
here in neutral language is the <unk>:gist of mr. mason 's remarks quoted first in the village voice while he was a paid spokesman for the rudolph giuliani mayoral campaign and then in newsweek after he and the campaign <unk>:parted company
mr. mason said that many jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks so they support black candidates <unk>:uncritically
he said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination so they too support black candidates <unk>:uncritically
he said that <unk>:jews have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice <unk>:versa
of course mr. mason did not use neutral language
as a <unk>:practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the <unk>:borscht belt live television and the <unk>:nightclub circuit mr. mason <unk>:instinctively reached for the <unk>:vernacular
he said <unk>:jews were sick with <unk>:complexes and he called david dinkins mr. giuliani 's black opponent a fancy <unk>:shvartze with a <unk>:mustache
if mr. mason had used less <unk>:derogatory language to <unk>:articulate his <unk>:amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow new <unk>:yorkers would the water be quite so hot
it probably would because few or none of the people upset by mr. mason 's remarks have bothered to <unk>:distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used <unk>:insulting language
in addition some of mr. mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of <unk>:racism
for example the new york state counsel for the <unk>:naacp said that mr. mason is like a <unk>:dinosaur
people are fast leaving the place where he is stuck
these critics fail to <unk>:distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at <unk>:disparaging another group such as polish jokes and the type that is <unk>:double-edged aiming <unk>:inward as well as <unk>:outward
the latter typically is the humor of the <unk>:underdog and it was <unk>:perfected by both blacks and <unk>:jews on the <unk>:minstrel and <unk>:vaudeville stage as a means of <unk>:mocking their white and <unk>:gentile audiences along with themselves
in the hands of a <unk>:zealot like <unk>:lenny bruce this <unk>:double-edged <unk>:blade could cut both the <unk>:self and the audience to <unk>:ribbons
but <unk>:wielded by a pro like <unk>:jackie mason it is a <unk>:constructive form of <unk>:mischief
why <unk>:constructive
because despite all the media <unk>:prattle about comedy and politics not <unk>:mixing they are similar in one respect both can serve as <unk>:mechanisms for easing <unk>:tensions and <unk>:facilitating the <unk>:co-existence of groups in conflict
that 's why it 's dangerous to have <unk>:well-intentioned thought police on college <unk>:campuses and elsewhere <unk>:taboo all critical mention of group differences
as elizabeth <unk>:kristol wrote in the new york times just before the mason <unk>:donnybrook perhaps <unk>:intolerance would not <unk>:boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to <unk>:simmer
the question is if group conflicts still exist as <unk>:undeniably they do and if mr. mason 's type of ethnic humor is <unk>:passe then what other means do we have for letting off steam
do n't say the tv <unk>:sitcom because that happens to be a <unk>:genre that in its desperate need to attract everybody and <unk>:offend nobody resembles politics more than it does comedy
it is true that the best <unk>:sitcoms do allow group differences to <unk>:simmer <unk>:yuppies vs. blue-collar <unk>:bostonians in <unk>:cheers children vs. adults in the cosby show
but these are not the differences that make <unk>:headlines
in chicken soup mr. mason plays <unk>:jackie a jewish <unk>:bachelor <unk>:courting <unk>:maddie lynn <unk>:redgrave an irish widow and mother of three against the wishes of his mother <unk>:rita <unk>:karin and her brother michael <unk>:brandon <unk>:maggart
it 's worth noting that both <unk>:disapproving <unk>:relatives are <unk>:immigrants
at least they both speak with strong <unk>:accents as do <unk>:jackie and <unk>:maddie
it could n't be more obvious that chicken soup is being made from an old <unk>:recipe
and a safe one imagine if the <unk>:romance in question were between an orthodox <unk>:jew and a member of the nation of <unk>:islam
back in the 1920s the play and movie versions of <unk>:abie 's irish rose made the theme of <unk>:courtship between the <unk>:assimilated <unk>:offspring of jewish and irish <unk>:immigrants so popular that its author anne <unk>:nichols lost a <unk>:plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public <unk>:domain
and it has remained there as <unk>:evidenced by its <unk>:reappearance in a N cbs <unk>:sitcom called <unk>:bridget <unk>:loves <unk>:bernie whose sole <unk>:distinction was that it led to the <unk>:real-life marriage of meredith <unk>:baxter and david <unk>:birney
clearly the question with chicken soup is not whether the pot will <unk>:boil over but whether it will <unk>:simmer at all
so far the <unk>:bubbles have been few and far between
part of the problem is the tendency of all <unk>:sitcoms ever since the <unk>:didactic days of norman <unk>:lear to <unk>:preach about social issues
to some extent this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to <unk>:enlighten us about ethnic <unk>:stereotypes by <unk>:reversing them
for instance michael <unk>:dislikes <unk>:jackie not because he 's a <unk>:shrewd jewish businessman but because he <unk>:quits his <unk>:well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker
even more <unk>:problematic is the <unk>:incompatibility between <unk>:sitcom <unk>:preachiness and mr. mason 's comic <unk>:persona
the best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end and occasionally in the middle when mr. mason <unk>:slips into his <unk>:standup mode and starts <unk>:meting out that old-fashioned jewish <unk>:mischief to other people as well as to himself
but too often these <unk>:routines lack spark because this <unk>:sitcom like all <unk>:sitcoms is <unk>:timid about <unk>:confronting mr. mason 's stock in trade <unk>:- ethnic differences
i 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the <unk>:catholic-jewish dispute over the <unk>:carmelite <unk>:convent at <unk>:auschwitz
that issue like racial <unk>:tensions in new york city will have to cool down not heat up before it can <unk>:simmer
but i am suggesting that they stop requiring mr. mason to <unk>:interrupt his classic <unk>:shtik with some line about <unk>:caring for other people that would sound <unk>:shmaltzy on the <unk>:lips of miss america

but senate supporters of the <unk>:trimmer legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside including a capital-gains tax cut
in addition the companion deficit-reduction bill already passed by the house includes a capital-gains provision
house-senate negotiations are likely to begin at <unk>:midweek and last for a while
no one can predict exactly what will happen on the house side said senate minority leader robert dole r. <unk>:kan <unk>:.
but he added i believe republicans and democrats will work together to get capital-gains reform this year
white house budget director richard darman told reporters yesterday that the administration would n't push to keep the capital-gains cut in the final version of the bill
we do n't need this as a way to get capital gains he said
house budget committee chairman leon <unk>:panetta d. calif <unk>:. said in an interview if that 's the signal that comes from the white house that will help a great deal
the senate 's decision was a setback for president bush and will make approval of a capital-gains tax cut less certain this year
opponents of the cut are playing <unk>:hardball
senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine said he was confident that any house-senate agreement on the deficit-reduction legislation would n't include a capital-gains tax cut
and a senior aide to the house ways and means committee where tax legislation <unk>:originates said there are n't any plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year
one obvious place to <unk>:attach a capital-gains tax cut and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit-reduction bill is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit
such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month
the senate bill was <unk>:pared back in an attempt to speed deficit-reduction through congress
because the legislation has n't been completed president bush has until midnight tonight to enact across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the gramm-rudman deficit-reduction law
senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the house to agree to the <unk>:streamlined bill
the house appears reluctant to join the senators
a key is whether house republicans are willing to <unk>:acquiesce to their senate colleagues ' decision to drop many pet provisions
although i am encouraged by the senate action said chairman dan <unk>:rostenkowski d. ill <unk>:. of the house ways and means committee it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the <unk>:upcoming conference with the senate
another big question <unk>:hovering over the debate is what president bush thinks
he has been <unk>:resisting a <unk>:stripped-down bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital-gains tax cut
but republican senators saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and <unk>:garner the N votes needed to win the capital-gains issue on the floor so they went ahead with the <unk>:streamlined bill
the senate bill was stripped of many popular though <unk>:revenue-losing provisions a number of which are included in the house-passed bill
these include a child-care initiative and <unk>:extensions of <unk>:soon-to-expire tax breaks for low-income housing and <unk>:research-and-development expenditures
also missing from the senate bill is the house 's repeal of a law called section N that <unk>:compels companies to give <unk>:rank-and-file workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives
one <unk>:high-profile provision that was originally in the senate bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by chairman lloyd <unk>:bentsen d. texas of the senate finance committee to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts
mr. <unk>:bentsen said he hopes the senate will consider that measure soon
to the <unk>:delight of some doctors the bill dropped a plan passed by the finance committee that would have <unk>:overhauled the entire <unk>:physician-reimbursement system under medicare
to the <unk>:detriment of many low-income people efforts to boost medicaid funding especially in rural areas also were <unk>:stricken
asked why senators were giving up so much new mexico sen. pete <unk>:domenici the ranking republican on the senate budget committee said we 're looking like <unk>:idiots
things had just gone too far
sen. dole said that the move required sacrifice by every senator
it worked others said because there were no exceptions all <unk>:revenue-losing provisions were <unk>:stricken
the senate also dropped a plan by its finance committee that would have increased the income <unk>:threshold beyond which senior citizens have their social security benefits reduced
in addition the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a N <unk>:excise tax on long-distance telephone calls
it no longer includes a plan that would have <unk>:repealed what remains of the <unk>:completed-contract method of accounting which is used by military contractors to reduce their tax burden
it also drops a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current <unk>:retirees
also <unk>:stricken was a <unk>:fivefold increase in the maximum <unk>:occupational safety and health administration penalties which would have raised $ N million in fiscal N
a provision that would have made the social security administration an independent agency was <unk>:excised
the approval of the senate bill was especially sweet for sen. mitchell who had proposed the streamlining
mr. mitchell 's relations with budget director darman who pushed for a capital-gains cut to be added to the measure have been <unk>:strained since mr. darman chose to <unk>:bypass the maine democrat and deal with other lawmakers earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal N supplemental spending bill
the deficit reduction bill contains $ N billion in tax increases in fiscal N and $ N billion over five years
the <unk>:revenue-raising provisions which affect mostly corporations would
prevent companies that have made leveraged buy-outs from getting federal tax refunds resulting from losses caused by interest payments on debt issued to finance the buy-outs effective aug. N N
require mutual funds to include in their taxable income dividends paid to them on the date that the dividends are declared rather than received effective the day after the tax bill is enacted
close a <unk>:loophole regarding employee stock ownership plans effective june N N that has been <unk>:exploited by investment bankers in corporate takeovers
the measure <unk>:repeals a N exclusion given to banks on the interest from loans used to acquire securities for an <unk>:esop if the <unk>:esop owns less than N of the employer 's stock
curb junk bonds by ending tax benefits for certain securities such as zero-coupon bonds that postpone cash interest payments
raise $ N million by <unk>:suspending for one year an automatic reduction in airport and <unk>:airway taxes
speed up the collection of the payroll tax from large companies effective august N

<unk>:withhold income taxes from the <unk>:paychecks of certain farm workers currently exempt from <unk>:withholding
change the collection of gasoline <unk>:excise taxes to weekly from <unk>:semimonthly effective next year
restrict the ability of real estate owners to escape taxes by <unk>:swapping one piece of property for another instead of selling it for cash
increase to $ N a person from $ N the international <unk>:air-passenger departure tax and impose a $ <unk>:3-a-person tax on international departures by commercial ships
the measure also includes spending cuts and increases in federal fees
among its provisions
reduction of medicare spending in fiscal N by some $ N billion in part by curbing increases in <unk>:reimbursements to physicians
the plan would impose a brief freeze on physician fees next year
removal of the u.s. postal service 's operating budget from the federal budget reducing the deficit by $ N billion
a similar provision is in the house version
authority for the federal aviation administration to raise $ N million by charging fees for commercial <unk>:airline-landing rights at new york 's <unk>:laguardia and john f. kennedy international airports <unk>:o'hare international airport in chicago and national airport in washington
increases in nuclear regulatory commission fees totaling $ N million

raising an additional $ N million by increasing existing federal communications commission fees and penalties and establishing new fees for <unk>:amateur radio operators ship stations and mobile radio facilities
john e. <unk>:yang contributed to this article
in response to your overly optimistic <unk>:outdated piece on how long unemployment lasts people patterns sept. N i am in the communications field above entry level
i was laid off in august N and after a <unk>:thorough and <unk>:exhausting job search was hired in august N
my unemployment insurance ran out before i found a job i found cutbacks and layoffs in many companies
the statistics quoted by the new census bureau report <unk>:garnered from N to N are out of date certainly as an average for the northeast and possibly for the rest of the country
i think what bothered me most about the piece was that there seemed to be an underlying attitude to tell your readers all is well if you 're getting laid off do n't worry and if you 're <unk>:unemployed it 's a seller 's market
to top it off you <unk>:captioned the <unk>:graph showing the average number of months in a job search as time off
are you <unk>:kidding
looking for a job was one of the most anxious periods of my life and is for most people
your paper needs a serious reality check

in friday 's edition the name of the unit was misstated
moody 's investors service said it reduced its rating on $ N million of subordinated debt of this beverly hills calif. thrift citing turmoil in the market for <unk>:low-grade high-yield securities
the agency said it reduced its rating on the thrift 's subordinated debt to <unk>:b-N from <unk>:ba-N and will keep the debt under review for possible further downgrade
columbia savings is a major holder of so-called junk bonds
new federal legislation requires that all thrifts <unk>:divest themselves of such speculative securities over a period of years
columbia savings officials were n't available for comment on the downgrade
franklin savings association <unk>:ottawa <unk>:kan
moody 's investors service inc. said it downgraded its rating to <unk>:b-N from <unk>:ba-N on less than $ N million of this thrift 's senior subordinated notes
the rating concern said franklin 's troubled diversification record in the securities business was one reason for the downgrade citing the troubles at its <unk>:l.f. rothschild subsidiary and the possible sale of other subsidiaries
they perhaps had concern that we were getting out of all these said franklin president <unk>:duane h. hall
i think it was a little <unk>:premature on their part
just when it seemed safe to go back into stocks wall street suffered another severe attack of nerves
does this signal another black monday is coming
or is this an extraordinary buying opportunity just like oct. N N eventually turned out to be
here 's what several leading market experts and money managers say about friday 's action what happens next and what investors should do
joseph <unk>:granville
i 'm the only one who said there would be an october massacre all through late august and september says mr. <unk>:granville once a widely followed market <unk>:guru and still a well-known newsletter writer
everyone will tell you that this time is different from N he says
well in some ways it is different but technically it is just the same
if you 're a <unk>:technician you <unk>:obey the signals
right now they 're telling me to get the hell out and stay out
i see no major support until N
i see a possibility of going to N this month
mr. <unk>:granville says he would n't even think of buying until at least N to N stocks have hit 52-week lows about N stocks hit new lows friday
most people he says have no idea what a massacre pattern looks like
<unk>:elaine <unk>:garzarelli
a <unk>:quantitative analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc. ms. <unk>:garzarelli had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the N crash
friday 's big drop she says was not a crash
this was an october massacre like those that occurred in N and N
now as in those two years her stock market indicators are positive
so she thinks the damage will be short-lived and contained
those <unk>:corrections lasted one to four weeks and took the market <unk>:10-N down she says
this is exactly the same thing as far as i 'm concerned
thus she says if the dow jones industrial average dropped below N it would just be a <unk>:fluke
my advice is to buy
as she <unk>:calculates it the average stock now sells for about N times companies ' earnings
she says that ratio could climb to N given current interest rates and still be within the range of fair value
<unk>:ned davis
friday 's fall marks the start of a bear market says mr. davis president of <unk>:ned davis research inc
but mr. davis whose views are widely respected by money managers says he expects no <unk>:1987-style crash
there was a unique combination in N he says
margin debt was at a record high
there was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds
the main thing was portfolio insurance a mechanical trading system intended to protect an investor against losses
a hundred billion dollars in stock was subject to it
in N such selling contributed to a <unk>:snowball effect
today could even be an up day mr. davis says if major brokerage firms agree to <unk>:refrain from program trading
over the next several months though he says things look bad
i think the market will be heading down into november he says
we will probably have a year-end rally and then go down again
sort of a <unk>:two-step bear market
he expects the downturn to carry the dow jones industrial average down to around N sometime next year
that would be a normal bear market he says
i guess that 's my forecast
leon g. <unk>:cooperman
i do n't think the market is going through another october <unk>:'N
i do n't think that 's the case at all says mr. <unk>:cooperman a partner at goldman sachs & co. and chairman of goldman sachs asset management
mr. <unk>:cooperman sees this as a good time to pick up bargains but he does n't think there 's any need to rush
i expect the market to open weaker monday but then it should find some stability
he <unk>:ticks off several major differences between now and two years ago
unlike N interest rates have been falling this year
unlike N the dollar has been strong
and unlike N the economy does n't appear to be in any danger of <unk>:overheating
but the economy 's slower growth this year also means the outlook for corporate profits is n't good he says
so it 's a very mixed bag
thus he concludes this is not a good environment to be fully invested in stocks
if i had come into friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios i would not do any buying
but we came into friday with a conservative portfolio so i would look to do some modest buying on behalf of clients
we 're going to look for some of the <unk>:better-known companies that got <unk>:clocked friday
john kenneth <unk>:galbraith
this is the latest <unk>:manifestation of the capacity of the financial community for <unk>:recurrent <unk>:insanity says mr. <unk>:galbraith an economist
i see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion he says
the explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has <unk>:lodged a lot of <unk>:insecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the <unk>:objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity
this has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable
nevertheless he says a depression does n't appear likely
there is more <unk>:resiliency in the economy at large than we commonly <unk>:suppose he says
it takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the <unk>:thirties much as the financial community and the government may try
mario <unk>:gabelli
new york money manager mario <unk>:gabelli an expert at <unk>:spotting takeover candidates says that takeovers are n't totally gone
companies are still going to buy companies around the world he says
examples are ford looking at jaguar bellsouth looking at lin broadcasting
these sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them so mr. <unk>:gabelli figures they will continue
the market was up N since president bush took office mr. <unk>:gabelli says so a correction was to be expected
he thinks another crash is unlikely and says he was <unk>:nibbling at selected stocks during friday 's plunge
stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity this week for guys like me he says
jim rogers
it seems to me that this is the <unk>:pin that has finally <unk>:pricked the balloon says mr. rogers a professor of finance at columbia university and former <unk>:co-manager of one of the most successful hedge funds in history quantum fund
he sees economic problems financial problems ahead for the u.s. with a fairly strong possibility of a recession
friday you could n't sell dollars he says
dealers would give you a quote but then refuse to make the trade
if the dollar stays weak he says that will add to <unk>:inflationary pressures in the u.s. and make it hard for the federal reserve board to ease interest rates very much
mr. rogers wo n't decide what to do today until he sees how the london and tokyo markets go
he recommends that investors sell <unk>:takeover-related stocks but hang on to some other stocks especially utilities which often do well during periods of economic weakness
frank <unk>:curzio
many people now claim to have predicted the N crash
<unk>:queens newsletter writer francis <unk>:x. <unk>:curzio actually did it he stated in writing in september N that the dow jones industrial average was likely to decline about N points the following month
mr. <unk>:curzio says what happens now will depend a good deal on the federal reserve board
if it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to banks he says that could quiet things down
if not we could go to N very soon
frank w. <unk>:terrizzi
stock prices would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks says mr. <unk>:terrizzi president and managing director of renaissance investment management inc. in cincinnati
renaissance which manages about $ N billion drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally
renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents primarily u.s. treasury bills
<unk>:t-bills probably are the right place to be he says
regarding the oct. N letter to the editor from rep. tom <unk>:lantos chairman of the house subcommittee on employment and housing alleging
N <unk>:. that your sept. N editorial <unk>:kangaroo committees was <unk>:factually inaccurate and deliberately misleading
i thought your editorial was <unk>:factually accurate and deliberately <unk>:elucidative
N <unk>:. that mr. <unk>:lantos supported the rights of the witnesses to take the fifth amendment
yes he did
as i watched him on <unk>:c-span i heard him speak those lovely words about the bill of rights which he quotes from the <unk>:transcript of the hearings
he did repeat those nice <unk>:platitudes several times as an indication of his support for the constitution
he used about N words defending the witnesses ' constitutional rights
unfortunately by my rough guess he used better than N words <unk>:heaping <unk>:scorn on the witnesses for exercising the fifth
he <unk>:sandwiched his <unk>:praise of constitutional meat between large <unk>:loaves of <unk>:bilious commentary
as your editorial <unk>:rightly pointed out samuel <unk>:pierce former hud secretary and <unk>:lance wilson mr. <unk>:pierce 's former aide are currently being held up to <unk>:scorn for taking the fifth amendment
that certainly is not the supposed distorted reading indicated by mr. <unk>:lantos
N <unk>:. that his committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at hud
my colleagues and i fully realize we are not a court <unk>:... etc
<unk>:absolute <unk>:rubbish
by any reasonable man <unk>:criterion mr. <unk>:lantos and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted
apparently their verdict is in
right now they 're pursuing evidence
that 's not a bad way to proceed just somewhat different from standard american practice
how was that practice referred to when i was in school
<unk>:ah yes something called a star chamber
of course mr. <unk>:lantos <unk>:doth protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change
no doubt that 's partially true
everything that mr. <unk>:lantos says in his letter is partially true
he 's right about his subcommittee 's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior hud officials
but if his explanation of <unk>:motivation is true why is his investigation so <unk>:oriented as to identify criminal activity
why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and <unk>:inefficiency
such as what happened when congress wanted to know about $ N toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost
no mr. <unk>:lantos 's complaints simply wo n't wash
N <unk>:. that the journal <unk>:defends the <unk>:sleaze fraud waste <unk>:embezzlement <unk>:influence-peddling and abuse of the public that took place while mr. <unk>:pierce was secretary of hud etc. and so forth
no to my mind the journal did not defend <unk>:sleaze fraud waste <unk>:embezzlement <unk>:influence-peddling and abuse of the public trust <unk>:..
it defended appropriate constitutional <unk>:safeguards and practical common sense
the problem which the journal so <unk>:rightly pointed out in a number of articles is not the likes of mr. <unk>:lantos who after all is really a bit player on the stage but the attempt by congress to enhance itself into a <unk>:quasi-parliamentaryjudicial body
of course we 've also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective
the system is the problem not an individual member
individuals can always have their hands <unk>:slapped
it 's when such <unk>:slapping does n't occur that we 've got trouble
i do not by any means defend hud management
but i think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to american <unk>:notions of liberty and freedom than any <unk>:incompetency and yes maybe <unk>:criminality within hud could possibly generate
the last time i saw a similar congressional hearing was when <unk>:tail <unk>:gunner joe <unk>:mccarthy did his work
raymond <unk>:weber
<unk>:parsippany n.j
i disagree with the statement by mr. <unk>:lantos that one should not draw an adverse <unk>:inference against former hud officials who <unk>:assert their fifth amendment privilege against <unk>:self-incrimination in congressional hearings
the fifth amendment states in relevant part that no person shall be <unk>:compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself
this privilege against <unk>:self-incrimination <unk>:precludes the drawing of an adverse <unk>:inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify
thus in a criminal case a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be <unk>:compelled to take the stand as a witness thus forcing him to take the fifth
the privilege however has been limited in <unk>:accordance with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only
the supreme court and some states have specifically recognized that the fifth amendment does not preclude the <unk>:inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause
<unk>:baxter v. <unk>:palmingiano N u.s. N N
thus in a civil case a defendant may be called as a witness he may be forced to testify or take the fifth and his taking of the fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse <unk>:inference against him in the civil matter
he may take the fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and <unk>:justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution
allowing the defendant to take the fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony <unk>:harms him in the civil matter but because the testimony in the civil matter could be <unk>:unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution
<unk>:absent the risk of such prosecution a court may order the defendant to testify
thus when mr. <unk>:pierce asserted the fifth in a <unk>:noncriminal proceeding particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel one must conclude that he held a <unk>:good-faith <unk>:justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution
the subcommittee congress and the american public have every right to draw the adverse <unk>:inference and to <unk>:concur with mr. <unk>:pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help <unk>:convict him of a crime
drawing the adverse <unk>:inference in a <unk>:noncriminal congressional hearing does not <unk>:offend the fifth amendment shield against <unk>:self-incrimination
clark s. <unk>:spalsbury jr

it was friday the 13th and the stock market plummeted nearly N points
just a <unk>:coincidence
or is <unk>:triskaidekaphobia fear of the number N justified
in <unk>:academia a so-called friday the 13th effect has been set up and shot down by different professors
robert <unk>:kolb and <unk>:ricardo <unk>:rodriguez professors of finance at the university of miami found evidence that the market is spooked by friday the 13th
but their study which <unk>:spanned the <unk>:1962-N period has since been shown to be <unk>:jinxed by an <unk>:unlucky choice of data
in the <unk>:'70s the market took falls nine times in a row on friday the <unk>:you-know-what
but the date tends to be a plus not a minus for stocks according to yale <unk>:hirsch a <unk>:collector of stock market <unk>:lore
another study found that the N <unk>:fridays the 13th in the <unk>:1940-N period had higher than average returns higher even than <unk>:fridays in general which tend to be strong days for stock prices
on the only other friday the 13th this year the dow jones industrial average rose about four points
professor <unk>:kolb says the original study titled friday the 13th part <unk>:vii was published <unk>:tongue-in-cheek
in a similar <unk>:vein he adds that the anniversary of the N crash and saturday 's full moon could have played a part too in friday 's market activity
<unk>:reminiscent of those during the N crash that as stock prices plummeted and trading activity <unk>:escalated some phone calls to market makers in over-the-counter stocks went <unk>:unanswered
we could n't get dealers to answer their phones said robert king senior vice president of otc trading at <unk>:robinson-humphrey co. in atlanta
it was like the friday before black monday two years ago
whether <unk>:unanswered phone calls had any effect or not nasdaq stocks sank far less than those on the new york and american exchanges
nonetheless the nasdaq composite index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever <unk>:diving N or N to N
ten points of the drop occurred during the last N minutes of trading
by comparison the new york stock exchange composite tumbled N friday and the american stock exchange composite fell N
on oct. N N the nasdaq composite fell N points or N followed by its devastating <unk>:N.12-point or N slide three days later
nasdaq volume friday totaled N million shares which was only the fifth busiest day so far this year
the <unk>:single-day record of N million shares was set on oct. N
there was n't a lot of volume because it was just impossible to get stock moved said <unk>:e.e. <unk>:buzzy <unk>:geduld president of <unk>:herzog <unk>:heine <unk>:geduld a new york company that makes markets in thousands of otc issues
most of the complaints about <unk>:unanswered phone calls came from regional brokers rather than individual investors
mr. king of <unk>:robinson-humphrey and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from traders ' inability to handle the volume of calls rather than a <unk>:deliberate attempt to avoid making trades
the subject is a <unk>:sore one for nasdaq and its <unk>:market-making companies which were widely criticized two years ago following complaints from investors who could n't reach their brokers or trade in the chaos of the crash
peter dapuzzo head of retail equity trading at shearson lehman hutton declared it was the last hour of trading on a friday
there were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market makers to be as efficient as robots
it was n't <unk>:intentional we were all busy
james <unk>:tarantino head of otc trading at hambrecht & quist in san francisco said it was just like two years ago
everybody was trying to do the same thing at the same time
<unk>:jeremiah mullins the otc trading chief at dean witter reynolds in new york said <unk>:proudly that his company executed every order it received by the close of trading
but he added you can only take one call at a time
market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur
on days like friday that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to
when selling is so <unk>:frenzied prices fall <unk>:steeply and fast
two years ago faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories market makers themselves began <unk>:dumping shares <unk>:exacerbating the slide in otc stock prices
on friday some market makers were selling again traders said
but with profits sagging on wall street since the crash companies have kept smaller share <unk>:stockpiles on hand
mr. <unk>:tarantino of hambrecht & quist said some prices fell without trades taking place as market makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares
everyone was hitting everyone else 's bid he said
so while otc companies incurred losses on friday trading officials said the damage was n't as bad as it was in N
two years ago we were carrying huge inventories and that was the big <unk>:culprit
i do n't know of anyone carrying big inventories now said mr. king of <unk>:robinson-humphrey
tony <unk>:cecin head of equity trading at <unk>:piper <unk>:jaffray & <unk>:hopwood in minneapolis said that <unk>:piper <unk>:jaffray actually made money on friday
it helped that his inventory is a third smaller now than it was two years ago he said
joseph <unk>:hardiman president of the national association of securities dealers which oversees the nasdaq computerized trading system said that despite the rush of selling he never considered the situation an emergency
the pace of trading was orderly he said
nasdaq 's small order execution system worked <unk>:beautifully as did the automated system for larger trades according to mr. <unk>:hardiman
nevertheless the shock of another steep plunge in stock prices undoubtedly will shake many investors ' confidence
in the past the otc market <unk>:thrived on a firm base of <unk>:small-investor participation
because nasdaq 's trading volume has n't returned to <unk>:pre-crash levels traders and otc market officials hope the damage wo n't be permanent
but they are worried
we were just starting to get the public 's confidence back <unk>:lamented mr. mullins of dean witter
more troubling is the prospect that the overall collapse in stock prices could permanently erode the base of <unk>:small-investor support the otc market was struggling to rebuild in the wake of the october N crash
mr. <unk>:cecin of <unk>:piper <unk>:jaffray says some action from government policy makers would <unk>:allay investor fears
it wo n't take much more to scare the hell out of retail investors he says
the sellers on friday came from all corners of the otc market big and small institutional investors as well as individual investors and market makers
but <unk>:grateful traders said the sell orders generally ranged from N shares to N shares compared with blocks of N shares or more two years ago
shearson 's mr. dapuzzo said retail investors nervously sold stock friday and never returned to <unk>:bargain-hunt
institutional investors which had been selling stock throughout last week to lock in <unk>:handsome gains made through the third quarter were <unk>:calmer
we had a good amount of selling from institutions but not as much panic mr. dapuzzo said
if they could n't sell some of them put the shares back on the shelf
in addition he said some bigger institutional investors placed bids to buy some otc stocks whose prices were beaten down
in addition mr. dapuzzo said computer-guided program selling of otc stocks in the russell index of N small stocks and the standard & poor 's 500-stock index sent <unk>:occasional waves through the market
nasdaq 's biggest stocks were <unk>:hammered
the nasdaq N index of the largest <unk>:nonfinancial issues including the big otc technology issues tumbled N or N to N
the nasdaq financial index of giant insurance and banking stocks dropped N or N to N
the otc market has only a handful of <unk>:takeover-related stocks
but they fell sharply
mccaw cellular communications for instance has offered to buy lin broadcasting as well as metromedia 's new york city cellular telephone interests and in a separate transaction sell certain mccaw properties to contel cellular
mccaw lost N or N N to N
lin broadcasting dropped N N or N to N N
the turnover in both issues was roughly normal

pension funds insurers and other <unk>:behemoths of the investing world said they began <unk>:scooping up stocks during friday 's market rout
and they plan to buy more today
<unk>:rightly or <unk>:wrongly many giant institutional investors appear to be fighting the latest war by applying the lesson they learned in the october N crash buying at the bottom pays off
to be sure big investors might put away their <unk>:checkbooks in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower today
they could still panic and bail out of the market
but their N performance indicates that they wo n't abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse
last time we got <unk>:rewarded for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst said john w. rogers president of chicago-based <unk>:ariel capital management inc. which manages $ N billion of stocks
mr. rogers spent half his cash on hand friday for our favorite stocks that have fallen apart
he expects to invest the rest if the market <unk>:weakens further
<unk>:denver-based portfolio manager james craig was n't <unk>:daunted when friday 's rout <unk>:shaved $ N million from the value of the $ N million <unk>:janus fund he oversees
i waited to make sure all the program trades had kicked through he said
then he jumped into the market
i spent $ N million in the last half-hour
other money managers also opened their <unk>:wallets
i was buying at the close friday and i 'll be buying again because i know we 're getting good value said frederick a. <unk>:moran president of <unk>:moran asset management inc. greenwich conn
there is no <unk>:justification on the fundamental level for this crash
unlike mutual funds which can be forced to sell <unk>:stockholdings when investors rush to withdraw money big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market <unk>:storms without <unk>:jettisoning stock
most often they do just that because stocks have proved to be the <unk>:best-performing long-term investment attracting about $ N trillion from pension funds alone
if you bought after the crash you did very very well off the bottom said stephen b. <unk>:timbers chief investment officer of chicago-based kemper financial services inc
the $ N billion california public employees retirement system for one added $ N billion to its stock portfolio two years ago
the last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long-term holders and that they ca n't react to short-term events good or bad said stephen l. <unk>:nesbitt senior vice president for the pension consultants <unk>:wilshire associates in santa <unk>:monica calif
those that pulled out of stocks <unk>:regretted it he said so i doubt you 'll see any significant changes in institutional portfolios as a result of friday 's decline

even friday 's slump leaves investors ahead more than N well above the annual average for stocks over several decades
you could go down N points and still have a good year in the market said james d. <unk>:awad president of new york-based <unk>:bmi capital corp
mr. <unk>:awad however worries that the market could go down N or N points in the next few days
it can happen before you can turn around
he said he <unk>:discerns many parallels with N including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the <unk>:re-emergence of computerized program trading
the only thing you do n't have he said is the portfolio insurance ' phenomenon <unk>:overlaid on the rest
most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique which is widely thought to have <unk>:worsened the N crash
not really insurance this <unk>:tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of s&p futures contracts
in its <unk>:severest test the $ N billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the N crash did n't work as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became <unk>:disconnected

mr. <unk>:weisman predicts stocks will appear to stabilize in the next few days before declining again <unk>:trapping more investors
i think it will be a <unk>:rigor <unk>:mortis rally he said
meanwhile friday brought a <unk>:reprieve for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally
especially <unk>:gleeful were the short sellers who have been <unk>:pounded by this year 's market climb

food and drug administration spokesman jeff <unk>:nesbit said the agency has turned over evidence in a criminal investigation concerning <unk>:vitarine pharmaceuticals inc. to the u.s. attorney 's office in baltimore
neither <unk>:vitarine nor any of the <unk>:springfield gardens n.y. company 's officials or employees have been charged with any crimes
<unk>:vitarine won approval to market a version of a blood pressure medicine but acknowledged that it <unk>:substituted a <unk>:smithkline <unk>:beecham plc product as its own in tests
mr. <unk>:nesbit also said the fda has asked <unk>:bolar pharmaceutical co. to recall at the retail level its <unk>:urinary <unk>:tract <unk>:antibiotic
but so far the company has n't <unk>:complied with that request the spokesman said
<unk>:bolar the subject of a criminal investigation by the fda and the inspector general 's office of the health and human services department only agreed to recall two strengths of its version of <unk>:macrodantin as far down as direct customers mostly <unk>:wholesalers mr. <unk>:nesbit said
<unk>:bolar of <unk>:copiague n.y. earlier began a voluntary recall of both its N <unk>:milligram and N <unk>:milligram versions of the drug
the fda has said it presented evidence it uncovered to the company indicating that <unk>:bolar <unk>:substituted the <unk>:brand-name product for its own to gain government approval to sell generic versions of <unk>:macrodantin

the west german retailer <unk>:asko deutsche <unk>:kaufhaus ag plans to challenge the <unk>:legality of a widely employed anti-takeover defense of companies in the netherlands
the eventual court decision could become a landmark in dutch corporate law because the lawsuit <unk>:asko plans to file would be the first to challenge the entire principle and practice of companies issuing voting preferred shares to <unk>:management-controlled trusts to <unk>:dilute voting power of common stockholders
up to now only specific aspects of these defenses have been challenged though unsuccessfully <unk>:asko 's dutch lawyers noted
should the courts <unk>:uphold the <unk>:validity of this type of defense <unk>:asko will then ask the court to <unk>:overturn such a <unk>:vote-diluting maneuver recently deployed by <unk>:koninklijke <unk>:ahold <unk>:nv
<unk>:asko says the <unk>:dutch-based international food retailer had n't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus <unk>:dilute the worth and voting power of <unk>:asko and other shareholders
speaking through its dutch lawyers <unk>:asko also disclosed it holds a N stake in <unk>:ahold
it was previously thought <unk>:asko held a N stake that was accumulated since july
a spokesman for <unk>:ahold said his company is confident of its own position and the <unk>:propriety of the <unk>:preferred-share issue
he termed <unk>:asko 's legal actions as <unk>:unproductive to international cooperation among european retailers
chase manhattan bank chairman <unk>:willard butcher is a conservative banker and a loyal republican but on friday morning he had few kind words for president bush 's economic <unk>:policy-making
there are some very significant issues out there such as the fiscal deficit the trade deficit our relations with japan that have to be the subject of major initiatives he said in an interview
i 'd like to see that initiative and i have n't
there is n't a big shot an agenda
a few hours later the stock market dropped N points
politicians tried to finger each other for the blame although many analysts doubt that washington was <unk>:singly responsible for wall street 's woes
but mr. butcher 's comments make one thing clear some on wall street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy
consider this
by N p.m. tonight president bush must order $ N billion of automatic across-the-board cuts in government spending to comply with the gramm-rudman budget law
the cuts are necessary because congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a <unk>:deficit-cutting bill
we simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices house budget committee chairman leon <unk>:panetta d. calif <unk>:. said yesterday on nbc news 's meet the press
for the last two weeks the bush administration and the federal reserve have been engaged in a <unk>:semi-public battle over international economic policy
the administration has been trying to push the dollar lower the fed has been <unk>:resisting
one of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary <unk>:warfare between the treasury department and the federal reserve board said lawrence <unk>:kudlow a bear stearns & co. economist on abc 's this week
the administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spate of airline takeovers
last month transportation secretary sam skinner forced northwest airlines to reduce a stake held by <unk>:klm royal dutch airlines
but he has since run into opposition from the treasury and the white house over that decision
and he has kept <unk>:mum on how his decision might affect a bid for united airlines which includes a big stake by british airways plc
some analysts say uncertainty about washington 's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the united airlines takeover fell through the event that triggered the market drop
in many ways the backdrop to friday 's stock decline is <unk>:eerily similar to that of october N 's <unk>:508-point crash
then as now the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold
the treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy although at that time it was with west german officials rather than the federal reserve
and concern about official actions aimed at takeovers then by the <unk>:tax-writing house ways and means committee rather than the transportation department were making markets nervous
the N crash brought the reagan administration and democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ N billion even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ N billion during that period
but barring further drops in the market this week a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year
lawmakers and administration officials agree that friday 's drop by itself is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-reaching than last spring 's <unk>:gimmick-ridden plan which still is n't fully implemented
one of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that as everyone learned in N the economy and the market can survive a one-day <unk>:508-point tumble
everybody thought we were looking at a <unk>:repetition of N that we were looking at a recession rep. <unk>:panetta said yesterday in an interview
that did not happen
they learned they could survive it without much problem
but administration officials privately agree with mr. <unk>:panetta who said a <unk>:precipitous drop this week is going to force the president and congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy
in that case there will be plenty of blame to go around
there is an underlying concern on the part of the american people and there should be <unk>:- that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut said senate finance committee chairman lloyd <unk>:bentsen d. texas
nevertheless it clearly will take more than friday 's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and white house budget director richard darman over the capital-gains fight
hill democrats are particularly angry over mr. bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of april 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation
there is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine said yesterday on cbs news 's face the nation
during last week 's <unk>:maneuverings on the <unk>:deficit-cutting bill and the capital-gains issue there were signs that senate republicans and the administration were at odds
at the very moment that senate republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it
when an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation oregon sen. bob packwood the ranking gop member of the <unk>:tax-writing senate finance committee hailed it
asked if the administration agreed he <unk>:curtly replied the <unk>:adminstration will have to speak for itself
friday 's market tumble could spur action on <unk>:reconciling the house and senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the <unk>:soonest
senate republicans expressed the hope that the house would follow the lead of the senate which on friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal N deficit
the market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction and the best way to do that is for the house of representatives to strip their bill of similar provisions sen. warren <unk>:rudman r. <unk>:n.h <unk>:. <unk>:. said yesterday
the white house office of management and budget whose calculations determine whether the gramm-rudman targets are met estimated that the house-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal N <unk>:shortfall by $ N billion almost half of the congressional budget office 's estimate of $ N billion
rep. <unk>:panetta said that <unk>:omb 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts but added we 're getting very close to the margins here
no one in washington was willing to take the blame for <unk>:provoking friday 's drop in the stock market
but some players were quick to seize the moment
before the sun had set on friday richard <unk>:rahn the <unk>:supply-side chief economist of the u.s. chamber of commerce issued a statement <unk>:attributing the drop in stock prices to the senate decision to postpone action on capital gains
investors who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell were spooked he said
there have been many <unk>:preposterous reasons advanced to support a capital-gains tax cut sen. mitchell said during his television appearance but i suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others

in fact some of the association 's members long-term <unk>:buy-and-hold investors welcomed the drop in prices
we hope to take advantage of it said john <unk>:snyder a member of a los angeles investors ' club
he has four stocks in mind to buy if the prices drop to the level he wants

marc <unk>:perkins a tampa fla. investment banker said the market drop is one of a tremendous number of signs that the leveraged <unk>:take-out era is ending
there 's no question that there 's a general <unk>:distaste for leverage among lenders

<unk>:sara albert a <unk>:34-year-old dallas law student says she 's generally <unk>:skittish about the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it
i have this feeling that it 's built on sand she says that the market rises but there 's no foundation to it
she and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the N crash although she still owns some texaco stock
partly because of concern about the economy and partly because she recently quit her job as a legal assistant to go to school i think at this point we want to be a lot more liquid
others wonder how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand
we all assumed october <unk>:'N was a one-time shot said san francisco attorney david greenberg
we told the little guy it could only happen once in a lifetime come on back
now it 's happening again
mr. greenberg got out just before the N crash and to his regret never went back even as the market soared

still he adds we ca n't have this kind of thing happen very often

the crowded field for <unk>:notebook-sized computers is about to become a lot more crowded
compaq computer corp. 's long-awaited entry today into the notebook field is expected to put immediate heat on others in the market especially zenith electronics corp. the current market leader and on a <unk>:swarm of promising <unk>:start-ups
compaq 's series of <unk>:notebooks <unk>:extends a trend toward <unk>:downsizing in the personal computer market
one manufacturer already has produced a <unk>:clipboard-sized computer called a <unk>:notepad and two others have introduced even smaller <unk>:palmtops
but those machines are still considered <unk>:novelties with <unk>:keyboards only a <unk>:munchkin could love and screens to match
compaq 's <unk>:notebooks by contrast may be the first in their weight class not to <unk>:skimp on features found in much bigger machines
analysts say they 're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market and they 're priced aggressively at $ N to $ N
all of this comes in a machine that <unk>:weighs only six pounds and fits <unk>:comfortably into most <unk>:briefcases
in recent months compaq 's competition including zenith toshiba corp. tandy corp. and nec corp. all have introduced <unk>:portables that weigh approximately the same and that are called <unk>:notebooks perhaps <unk>:misleadingly
one analyst noting that most such machines are about two inches thick takes exception to the name
this is n't quite a notebook i call it a <unk>:phonebook he says
that ca n't be said of the $ N <unk>:notepad computer introduced a few weeks ago by grid systems corp. a unit of tandy
instead of a <unk>:keyboard it features a writing surface an electronic <unk>:pen and the ability to read block printing
at N N pounds it may be too <unk>:ambitiously named but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analysts <unk>:froth
<unk>:palmtops are n't far behind
<unk>:atari corp. 's portfolio introduced in europe two months ago and in the u.s. in early september <unk>:weighs less than a pound costs a mere $ N and runs on three <unk>:aa <unk>:batteries yet has the power to run some <unk>:spreadsheets and word processing programs
some critics however say its ability to run <unk>:commonplace programs is restricted by a limited memory
<unk>:poquet computer corp. meanwhile has introduced a much more sophisticated <unk>:palmtop that can run lotus <unk>:1-2-N and other sophisticated software programs but costs five times as much
at stake is what mike <unk>:swavely compaq 's president of north america operations calls the <unk>:holy <unk>:grail of the computer industry the search for a real computer in a package so small you can take it everywhere
the market is so new nobody knows yet how big it can be
i 've had a lot of people trying to sell me services to find out how big it is says tom <unk>:humphries director of marketing for grid
whether it 's $ N billion or $ N billion it does n't matter
it 's huge
consider the growth of <unk>:portables which now <unk>:comprise N of all personal computer sales
<unk>:laptops generally anything under N pounds have become the fastest-growing personal computer segment with sales doubling this year
responding to that demand however has led to a variety of <unk>:compromises
making computers smaller often means <unk>:sacrificing memory
it also has <unk>:precluded use of the faster more powerful microprocessors found in increasing numbers of desktop machines
size and weight considerations also have limited screen displays
the competitive <unk>:sniping can get pretty <unk>:petty at times
a <unk>:poquet spokesman for example <unk>:criticizes the <unk>:atari portfolio because it requires three <unk>:batteries while the <unk>:poquet needs only two
both <unk>:palmtops are dismissed by notebook makers who argue that they 're too small a problem <unk>:poquet also encountered in focus groups admits <unk>:gerry <unk>:purdy director of marketing
<unk>:poquet trying to avoid the <unk>:gadget label responded with the tag line the <unk>:poquet pc a very big computer
despite the <unk>:sniping few question the <unk>:inevitability of the move to small machines that do n't make <unk>:compromises
toward that end experts say the real battle will take place between <unk>:center-stage players like toshiba zenith and now compaq
compaq 's new machines are considered a direct threat to start-up firms like <unk>:dynabook inc. which introduced in june a computer that like compaq 's uses an intel N microprocessor and has a hard disk drive
but the <unk>:dynabook product is twice as heavy and costs more than compaq 's
compaq 's announcement also <unk>:spells trouble for zenith which last year had N of the u.s. laptop market but recently agreed to sell its computer business to cie. des machines bull the french government-owned computer maker
zenith holders will vote in december on the proposed $ N million sale a price that could slip because it is pegged to zenith 's share and sales
compaq is already taking aim at zenith 's market share
rod <unk>:canion compaq 's president and chief executive officer notes <unk>:pointedly that zenith 's $ N <unk>:minisport uses an <unk>:unconventional <unk>:two-inch <unk>:floppy disk <unk>:whereas compaq 's new machines use the more common N <unk>:12-inch disk
john p. frank president of zenith data systems simply <unk>:shrugs off such criticism noting that N <unk>:12-inch <unk>:floppies were also <unk>:unconventional when they first replaced <unk>:five-inch disks
we do n't look at it as not being a standard we look at it as a new standard he argues
analysts do n't see it that way
i ca n't imagine that you 'll talk to anyone who wo n't tell you this is <unk>:dynamite for compaq and a <unk>:stopper for everyone else says gene <unk>:talsky president of professional marketing management inc
adds bill <unk>:lempesis senior industry analyst for <unk>:dataquest a high-technology market research firm we basically think that these are very hot products
the problem compaq is going to have is that they wo n't be able to make enough of them
compaq 's machines include the N <unk>:12-inch <unk>:floppy disk drive a <unk>:backlit screen that is only <unk>:14-inch thick and an internal expansion <unk>:slot for a <unk>:modem in other words almost all the <unk>:capabilities of a typical office machine

toshiba 's line of <unk>:portables for example features the <unk>:t-N which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory and the <unk>:t-N which also uses a N microprocessor but which <unk>:weighs almost twice as much and is three times the size
a third model marketed in japan may hit the u.s. by the end of the first quarter of N but by then analysts say compaq will have established itself as one of three major players

investors who bought stock with borrowed money that is on margin may be more worried than most following friday 's market drop
that 's because their brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans
in october N these margin calls were thought to have contributed to the downward <unk>:spiral of the stock market
typically a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below N of its original value
if the investor does n't put up the extra cash to satisfy the call the brokerage firm may begin <unk>:liquidating the securities
but some big brokerage firms said they do n't expect major problems as a result of margin calls
margin calls since friday have been higher than usual but reasonable a spokesman for shearson lehman hutton inc. said
merrill lynch & co. officials do n't expect margin calls to be as big a factor as in N because fewer individual investors are buying stock on margin a spokesman said
hugo <unk>:quackenbush senior vice president at charles schwab corp. the san <unk>:francisco-based discount brokerage firm said he did n't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for schwab customers

the garden city n.y. <unk>:car-rental company said it wo n't renew contracts with nwa inc. 's northwest airlines unit pan am corp. 's pan american world airways unit and <unk>:midway airlines at the end of this year
but it remains involved in programs with amr corp. 's american airlines unit and delta air lines
industry estimates put <unk>:avis 's annual cost of all five programs at between $ N million and $ N million
a spokesman for <unk>:avis would n't specify the costs but said the three airlines being dropped account for far less than half of the total
budget rent a car corp. of chicago and national car rental systems inc. of minneapolis both said they had no plans to follow suit
in fact budget indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs in which <unk>:renters earn <unk>:frequent-flier miles and <unk>:fliers can get <unk>:car-rental discounts
i can not see how this news by hertz and <unk>:avis can not benefit budget 's programs said bob wilson budget 's vice president marketing planning
northwest and <unk>:midway are two of the five airlines with which budget has agreements
national also <unk>:participates in the northwest <unk>:frequent-flier program along with four other airlines including delta and usair group inc. 's usair unit
a month ago hertz of park <unk>:ridge n.j. said that it would drop its marketing agreements at year end with delta america west and texas air corp.

at the time hertz said its annual fees to those airlines amounted to $ N million and that the value of redeemed <unk>:awards topped $ N million
analysts and competitors however doubt the numbers were that high
budget said its <unk>:frequent-flier costs are substantially below <unk>:avis 's level
robert d. <unk>:cardillo <unk>:avis vice president of marketing said the proliferation and costs attached to <unk>:frequent-flier programs have significantly diminished their value
this year has been difficult for both hertz and <unk>:avis said charles <unk>:finnie <unk>:car-rental industry analyst at alex <unk>:. brown & sons
they 've been looking to get their costs down and this is a fairly <unk>:sensible way to do it he said

tandem computers inc. preparing to fight with international business machines corp. for a piece of the mainframe business said it expects to post higher revenue and earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended sept. N
tandem said it expects to report revenue of about $ N million and earnings of N cents to N cents a share
the results which are in line with analysts ' estimates reflect a continued improvement in our u.s. business said james <unk>:treybig tandem 's chief executive officer
in the year-earlier period tandem reported net income of $ N million or N cents a share on revenue of $ N million
tandem expects to report the full results for the quarter next week
analysts have predicted that the cupertino calif. company will report revenue of $ N million to $ N million and earnings of N cents to N cents a share
commenting on the results for the quarter mr. <unk>:treybig said the strength of the company 's domestic business came as a surprise to him noting that sales in every region of the u.s. exceeded our plan
the company 's u.s. performance was helped by a record quarter for new customers he said
tandem makes <unk>:fault-tolerant computers machines with <unk>:built-in backup systems that run stock exchanges networks of automatic <unk>:tellers and other complex computer systems
tomorrow the company is scheduled to announce its most powerful computer ever which for the first time will bring it into direct competition with makers of mainframe computers
tandem 's new high-end computer is called <unk>:cyclone
prices for the machine which can come in various <unk>:configurations are $ N million to $ N million
analysts expect the new computer to <unk>:wrest a hefty <unk>:slice of business away from ibm the longtime leader in mainframes
we believe they could <unk>:siphon perhaps two to three billion dollars from ibm over the next few years said george weiss an analyst at the gartner group
that will spur tandem 's growth
i 'd be disappointed if the company grew by less than N next year said john <unk>:levinson an analyst at goldman sachs & co
ibm is expected to respond to tandem 's <unk>:cyclone by discounting its own mainframes which analysts say are roughly three times the price of a comparable system from tandem
obviously ibm can give bigger discounts to users immediately said mr. weiss
but mr. <unk>:treybig questions whether that will be enough to stop tandem 's first mainframe from taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought from big blue 's machines
the answer is n't price reductions but new systems he said
nevertheless tandem faces a variety of challenges the biggest being that customers generally view the company 's computers as <unk>:complementary to ibm 's mainframes
even mr. <unk>:treybig is reluctant to abandon this notion insisting that tandem 's new machines are n't <unk>:replacements for ibm 's mainframes
we 're after a little bigger niche he said
do n't jump yet
the stock market 's <unk>:swoon may turn out to be good news for the economy
in one wild hour of trading the market managed to accomplish what the bush administration has been trying to do unsuccessfully for weeks
it is forcing the federal reserve to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously <unk>:irrepressible dollar
the resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could <unk>:reinvigorate american business indeed the entire economy
this may sound <unk>:strangely optimistic
after all until a few years ago the stock market was viewed as a barometer of the national economy
when it went down by all tradition the economy followed
that has changed partly because the two years following the worst stock-market plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable
the N crash was a false alarm however you view it says university of chicago economist victor <unk>:zarnowitz
the market seems increasingly <unk>:disconnected from the rest of the nation
its <unk>:spasms ca n't be <unk>:traced to fundamental business conditions nor do they appear to <unk>:presage major shifts in the economy
the market today has a life of its own john <unk>:akers chairman of international business machines corp. said saturday
there 's nothing rational about this kind of action
of course the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive this week
sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the u.s. now relies for financial <unk>:sustenance
the financial-services industry was battered by the N crash
what 's more although the stock market is far less <unk>:overvalued today than two years ago the u.s. economy is weaker
growth is slower
profits are softer
debt burdens are heavier
but if the stock market does n't continue to plummet the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate
the fed which until friday had been <unk>:resisting moves to ease credit is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to <unk>:soothe the markets
fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate policies
but the experience of the N crash suggests the fed is likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort to calm markets
anticipating the fed 's move money traders lowered a key interest rate known as the federal funds rate to N late friday down from N the day before
tiny movements in the rate which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans are usually among the few visible tracks that the fed leaves on the monetary markets
the dollar also began to decline friday as the stock market 's plunge caused some investors to <unk>:reassess their desire to invest in the u.s.
treasury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar 's strength was out of <unk>:whack with economic fundamentals threatening to <unk>:extinguish the export boom that has sustained manufacturers for several years
the market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the treasury was right about the <unk>:overpriced dollar
a modest drop in the dollar only a modest one mind you would be welcomed by the u.s.
that was n't the case in N when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse producing panic among foreign investors and <unk>:diminishing the flow of foreign capital to the u.s.
another big difference between N and N is n't so <unk>:comforting
in the third quarter of N the economy <unk>:spurted at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of N
the consensus among economists is that it grew a much more sluggish N in the third quarter of N which ended two weeks ago
the plunge in stock prices is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down says economist lawrence <unk>:chimerine of <unk>:wefa group a <unk>:bala <unk>:cynwyd pa. forecasting company
a lot of <unk>:pent-up demand is gone
consumer spending did drop in the months following black monday N but only slightly and for a short period of time recalls mr. <unk>:zarnowitz a longtime student of business cycles
that was offset by strength elsewhere
the effects were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected
today he <unk>:frets exports and business investment spending may be insufficient to pick up the slack if stock prices sink this week and if consumers <unk>:retrench in reaction
what 's more the corporate borrowing binge has n't <unk>:abated in the past two years
we 've had two more years of significant accumulation of debt <unk>:... just at the time when earnings are being squeezed mr. <unk>:chimerine notes
the more a company relies on borrowed money the greater its <unk>:sensitivity to an economic slowdown
a company with a strong balance sheet can withstand an unanticipated storm a highly leveraged company may end up in bankruptcy court
the fed of course knows that very well hence its <unk>:readiness to pump credit into the economy this morning
but in the process the fed risks <unk>:reigniting inflation
even before friday 's events harvard university economist benjamin <unk>:friedman was arguing that the fed wo n't be able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to protect fragile financial markets banks and highly leveraged corporations
the biggest threat on the economic horizon right now is n't recession he reasons it 's an <unk>:outbreak of <unk>:uncontrolled inflation
in the end the N collapse suggested the economy does n't move in <unk>:lockstep with stock prices
the economy does however depend on the confidence of businesses consumers and foreign investors
a panic on wall street does n't exactly <unk>:inspire confidence
surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before friday
a 190-point drop is n't likely to make much of a <unk>:dent <unk>:multiply that a few times over though and it will
if the reactions of executives gathered saturday at hot springs va. for the business council meetings are typical business leaders were n't overly rattled by friday 's decline
and if foreign investors become a <unk>:tad more cautious well the dollar 's recent strength suggests that the u.s. can stand it
on the bottom line the most <unk>:comforting fact for the economic outlook is that we 've been through this before
two years ago about the only point of comparison was the N crash and the subsequent depression
the <unk>:doomsayers had a <unk>:receptive audience
the prosperity that followed black monday permits a more optimistic view today
at the very least the establishment here is taking comfort from the nation 's success in handling the last <unk>:go-around
as sen. lloyd <unk>:bentsen d. texas observed yesterday the fed avoided a <unk>:meltdown last time
they are more sophisticated this time
the chemical industry is expected to report that profits eroded in the third quarter because of <unk>:skidding prices in the commodity end of the business
producers of commodity chemicals the basic chemicals produced in huge volumes for other manufacturers have seen sharp inventory cutting by buyers
once the chief beneficiaries of the industry 's now <unk>:fading boom these producers also will be reporting against exceptionally strong performances in the N third quarter
for some of these companies this will be the first quarter with year-to-year negative comparisons says leonard <unk>:bogner a chemical industry analyst at prudential <unk>:bache research
this could be the first of five or six down quarters
perhaps most prominent dow chemical co. which as of midyear had racked up eight consecutive record quarters is expected to report that profit decreased in the latest quarter from a year earlier if only by a <unk>:shade
though dow has aggressively diversified into specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals the company still has a big stake in polyethylene which is used in packaging and <unk>:housewares
analysts ' third-quarter estimates for the midland mich. company are between $ N a share and $ N a share compared with $ N a year ago when profit was $ N million on sales of $ N billion
a dow spokeswoman declined to comment on the estimates
at the investment firm of smith barney harris upham & co. the <unk>:commodity-chemical segment is seen pulling down overall profit for N companies representative of the whole industry by N to N
you will find the commodities off more than the others and the diversified companies about even or slightly better says james wilbur a smith barney analyst
first boston corp. projects that N of the N companies it follows will report lower profit
most of the N have big <unk>:commodity-chemical operations
still some industry giants are expected to report continuing gains largely because so much of their business is outside commodity chemicals
du pont co. is thought to have had steady profit growth in white <unk>:pigments fibers and <unk>:polymers
moreover the wilmington del. company is helped when prices weaken on the commodity chemicals it buys for its own production needs such as <unk>:ethylene
analysts are divided over whether du pont will report much of a gain in the latest quarter from its <unk>:conoco inc. oil company
the estimates for du pont range from $ N to $ N a share
in the N third quarter the company earned $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion
du pont declined to comment
monsanto co. too is expected to continue reporting higher profit even though its sales of crop chemicals were hurt in the latest quarter by drought in northern europe and the western u.s.
the st. <unk>:louis-based company is expected to report again that losses in its <unk>:g.d. searle & co. pharmaceutical business are narrowing
searle continued to operate in the red through the first half of the year but monsanto has said it expects searle to post a profit for all of N
most estimates for monsanto run between $ N and $ N a share
a year ago the company posted third-quarter profit of $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion
monsanto declined to comment
but the <unk>:commodity-chemical producers are caught on the downside of a pricing cycle
by some accounts on wall street and in the industry the inventory reductions are near an end which may <unk>:presage firmer demand
but <unk>:doubters say growing production capacity could keep pressure on prices into the early 1990s
in the latest quarter at least profit is expected to fall sharply
for <unk>:himont inc. how far down it is we do n't know says leslie <unk>:ravitz at salomon brothers
the projections are in the neighborhood of N cents a share to N cents compared with a restated $ N a share a year earlier when profit was $ N million on sales of $ N million
<unk>:himont faces lower prices for its mainstay product <unk>:polypropylene while it goes forward with a heavy capital investment program to bolster its raw material supply and develop new uses for <unk>:polypropylene whose markets include the packaging and automobile industries
the company based in wilmington del. is <unk>:81-owned by montedison s.p <unk>:. a. milan which has an offer outstanding for the <unk>:himont shares it does n't already own
at quantum chemical corp. new york the trouble is lower prices for polyethylene higher debt costs and the <unk>:idling of an important plant due to an explosion
some analysts hedge their estimates for quantum because it is n't known when the company will book certain one-time charges
but the estimates range from break-even to N cents a share
in the N third quarter quantum earned $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N million
another big polyethylene producer union carbide corp. is expected to post profit of between $ N a share and $ N compared with $ N a share a year earlier when the company earned $ N million on sales of $ N billion
